Purpose
=======

This file gives concise, actionable guidance for AI coding agents working on the `vu-library` repository. Focus is on the documentation website built with VitePress, the repository's folder conventions, where configuration lives, and common developer workflows (build, dev, preview).

**Big Picture**
- **Site:** The project is a static documentation site generated by VitePress. Main content lives in `docs/` and site config is in `docs/.vitepress/config.mts`.
- **Sidebar generation:** Navigation sidebars are computed from TypeScript data structures in `docs/.vitepress/theme/data/fileStructures/*.ts` and transformed via `docs/.vitepress/theme/utils/transformSectionsToSidebar.ts`.
- **Theme & assets:** Theme overrides and helpers are in `docs/.vitepress/theme/`. Public assets (logo, images) are in `public/` and referenced from `docs/.vitepress/config.mts`.

**Where to edit content**
- Add or edit Markdown pages under `docs/` following existing folder naming: e.g. `docs/java-script/1-data-types/01-basics/0-lexial_structure.md` corresponds to link `/java-script/1-data-types/01-basics/0-lexial_structure`.
- Update sidebars by editing the relevant `*Sections.ts` file in `docs/.vitepress/theme/data/fileStructures/`. The `transformToSidebar` utility generates the final sidebar structure for VitePress.

**Common workflows / commands**
- Install dependencies: `npm ci` (or `npm install`).
- Run local dev server: `npm run docs:dev` (starts VitePress dev server).
- Build production site: `npm run docs:build` (note the package.json uses `node --max-old-space-size=4096` for large builds).
- Preview a built site: `npm run docs:preview`.

**Configuration & plugins**
- Primary config: `docs/.vitepress/config.mts` (site title, nav, themeConfig). Change this to update global behavior.
- Markdown plugins: `markdown-it-katex` is used (math support), and `vitepress-plugin-mermaid` for diagrams. If you add new plugins, update `docs/.vitepress/config.mts` and `package.json`.

**Conventions & patterns specific to this repo**
- Sidebar items are not hand-written in `config.mts`; instead they call functions like `cSidebar()` which read from `*Sections.ts`. Change content in `docs/` and its corresponding `*Sections.ts` to ensure the sidebar shows new pages.
- Links in sidebar `link` entries are root-relative site paths (leading slash) — map those to `docs/` file paths when creating pages.
- The repository keeps generated and cache artifacts under `docs/.vitepress/.temp` and `docs/.vitepress/cache/` — do not modify these by hand.

**Files to reference often**
- `package.json` — scripts (`docs:dev`, `docs:build`, `docs:preview`).
- `docs/.vitepress/config.mts` — site-wide configuration and plugin setup.
- `docs/.vitepress/theme/` — theme, components and `utils/transformSectionsToSidebar.ts`.
- `docs/.vitepress/theme/data/fileStructures/*.ts` — canonical sidebar & section data.
- `public/` — static assets referenced by the site (e.g. `public/logo/logo.png`).

**Examples**
- To add a new JavaScript tutorial page:
  - Create `docs/java-script/new-topic/my-page.md` with frontmatter (if needed) and content.
  - Add an entry in `docs/.vitepress/theme/data/fileStructures/jsSections.ts` with `{ label: 'My Page', link: '/java-script/new-topic/my-page' }`.
  - Run `npm run docs:dev` to test locally.

**Do not change**
- Avoid editing generated build outputs under `docs/.vitepress/dist` or files under `docs/.vitepress/cache` — these are artifacts.
