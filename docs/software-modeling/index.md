# Software Modeling

This section covers various modeling techniques used in software engineering to analyze, design, and document software systems. These models provide a way to visualize the structure, behavior, and architecture of a system from different perspectives.

## Modeling Categories

We will explore the following categories of software models:

- **Context Modeling**: Defines the boundary and scope of a system by showing how it interacts with its external environment.
- **Interaction Modeling**: Illustrates the interactions between system components or between the system and its actors.
- **Structural Modeling**: Describes the static structure of the system, including its classes, components, and their relationships.
- **Behavioral Modeling**: Shows the dynamic behavior of the system in response to internal or external events.
- **C4 Model**: A modern, hierarchical approach to visualizing software architecture at different levels of abstraction.
- **C2-style Architecture**: A specific architectural style emphasizing a message-based communication paradigm among independent components.
