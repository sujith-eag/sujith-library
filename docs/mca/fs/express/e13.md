# Express: Product Catalog

Create an **Express.js** application that manages a catalog of products. Start with a predefined array of products, each having the properties **id**, **name**, **price**, and **stock**.

- Implement a **`PUT`** route at `/products/:id` that updates an existing product’s details. The request body may contain any combination of the three updatable fields: **name**, **price**, and **stock**.
	
- Your application should update only the fields provided in the request and leave the rest unchanged.
	
- If a product with the given ID is not found, return a **404 status** with a message indicating that the product does not exist.
	
- Ensure the use of `express.json()` middleware to process JSON bodies and return structured JSON responses that confirm the update and show the latest state of the product. Keep the application implementation in a single JavaScript file, without using a database or external files.
	

## `app.js`

```js
import express from 'express';

const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

// Middleware to parse JSON bodies
app.use(express.json());

// In-memory product catalog
let products = [
    { id: 1, name: 'Laptop', price: 1200, stock: 15 },
    { id: 2, name: 'Keyboard', price: 75, stock: 50 },
    { id: 3, name: 'Mouse', price: 25, stock: 100 }
];

// --- Routes ---

// PUT /products/:id - Update an existing product
app.put('/products/:id', (req, res) => {
    const productId = parseInt(req.params.id, 10);
    const { name, price, stock } = req.body;

    const product = products.find(p => p.id === productId);

    // Handle case where product is not found
    if (!product) {
        return res.status(404).json({ message: 'Product not found' });
    }

    // Update only the fields that are provided in the request body
    if (name !== undefined) {
        product.name = name;
    }
    if (price !== undefined) {
        product.price = price;
    }
    if (stock !== undefined) {
        product.stock = stock;
    }

    res.json({ message: 'Product updated successfully', product });
});

// GET route to view and test
app.get('/products', (req, res) => {
    res.json(products);
});


// Start the server
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

```bash
$ curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" 
	-d '{"name": "Charlie Brown", "price": 
		"Char@mail.com", "stock": 13}' 
		http://localhost:3000/products/1
```


## Test the API with Postman

#### Update an existing product (`PUT`)

1. Open Postman and create a new request.
    
2. Set the method to **PUT**.
    
3. Enter the URL for a specific product, for example: `http://localhost:3000/products/2`.
    
4. Go to the **Body** tab, select **raw**, and choose **JSON** from the dropdown.
    
5. In the text area, enter only the fields you want to update. For example, to update just the price and stock of the keyboard:

```json
{
	"price": 80,
	"stock": 45
}
```
    
6. Click **Send**. You will see a success message and the fully updated product object in the response.
    
#### Attempt to update a non-existent product (`PUT`)

1. In the same request, change the URL to an ID that doesn't exist, like: `http://localhost:3000/products/99`.
    
2. Click **Send**. The API will return a **404 Not Found** status with the message `"Product not found"`.
