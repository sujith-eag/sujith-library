# Interpretation and Report Writing:

Interpretation refers to the task of drawing inferences from collected facts after an analytical or experimental study. It involves establishing continuity in research by linking the results of a given study and developing explanatory concepts.

## Technique of Interpretation

The task of interpretation requires great skill and often involves the following four steps:

1. **Explanation:** The researcher must provide reasonable explanations for the relationships they have found. They need to interpret these relationships in terms of underlying processes and identify any uniform patterns beneath the surface of the research findings. This is how generalizations are made and concepts are formulated.
    
2. **Extraneous Information:** Any extraneous information collected during the study must be considered when interpreting the final results, as it may be a key factor in understanding the problem.
    
3. **Guidance:** Before finalizing the interpretation, it is wise to consult someone with insight into the study who is frank and honest. Such a person can point out omissions and errors in logical argumentation, leading to a more correct interpretation and enhancing the utility of the research results.
    
4. **Relevant Factors:** To avoid false generalizations, the researcher must consider all relevant factors affecting the problem before completing the interpretation. They should not be in a hurry, as initial conclusions may not always be accurate.
    
### Precaution in Interpretation

- Ensure data is appropriate.
    
- Maintain good homogeneity.
    
- Conduct proper analysis.
    
- Avoid errors.
    
## Report Writing

Re+port is to carry information again

Report is a document giving summarised and interpretative information of research done based on factual data. opinions and about procedures used by the individual or group

### Significance of Report Writing

A research report is a major component of a research study; without it, the research is incomplete. The purpose of research is not well-served if the findings are not communicated. Therefore, a report is required to communicate generalizations and findings to others, add the research results to the general store of knowledge, and serve as a good tool for decision-making.

### Different Steps in Writing a Report

1. **Logical analysis of the subject matter:** This is the first step and is concerned with the development of a subject. A subject can be developed logically (based on mental connections and analysis) or chronologically (based on a sequence in time).
    
2. **Preparation of the final outline:** Outlines are the framework for long written works. They aid in the logical organization of material and serve as a reminder of the points to be stressed.
    
3. **Preparation of the rough draft:** In this crucial step, the researcher writes down what they have done, including the procedures for collecting material, limitations faced, analysis techniques used, broad findings, and suggestions.
    
4. **Rewriting and polishing of the rough draft:** This is often the most difficult part of formal writing and can take more time than the initial draft. Careful revision distinguishes between a mediocre and a good piece of writing. The report should be checked for weaknesses in logical development and presentation.
    
5. **Preparation of the final bibliography:** The bibliography, appended to the report, is a list of books and other works pertinent to the research that the researcher consulted. It should be arranged alphabetically and can be divided into parts for books/pamphlets and magazines/newspapers.
    
    - **For books and pamphlets, the order is:**
        
        - Name of author, last name first.
            
        - Title, underlined to indicate italics.
            
        - Place, publisher, and date of publication.
            
        - Number of volumes.
            
        - _Example:_ Kothari, C.R., Quantitative Techniques, New Delhi, Vikas Publishing House Pvt. Ltd., 1978.
            
6. **Writing the final draft:** The final draft should be written in a concise, objective, and simple style, avoiding vague expressions like “it seems” or “there may be.” Abstract terminology and technical jargon should be avoided. Illustrations and examples from common experience should be used to effectively communicate findings. A research report should not be dull; it must maintain interest and show originality.
    

## Layout of the Research Report

A comprehensive layout includes:

1. **Preliminary Pages:** Title and date, followed by acknowledgements (Preface or Foreword), a table of contents, and a list of tables and illustrations.
    
2. **Main Text:** The complete outline of the research report with all details.
    
3. **End Matter:** Appendices, bibliography, and an index.

### Main Text Sections

- **Introduction:** Introduces the research project, including a clear statement of objectives and a brief summary of other relevant research.
    
- **Statement of findings and recommendations:** A non-technical statement of findings and recommendations that is easily understood. Extensive findings should be summarized here.
    
- **Results:** A detailed presentation of the study's findings with supporting data (tables, charts) and validation. This is the main body of the report and should contain statistical summaries, not raw data.
    
- **Implications of the results:** Inferences drawn from the study that may apply in similar circumstances, conditions of the study that may limit generalizations, and remaining or new questions raised by the study.
    
- **Summary:** A brief summary of the research problem, methodology, major findings, and conclusions.
    
### End Matter

- **Appendices:** Include all technical data, such as questionnaires, sample information, and mathematical derivations.
    
- **Bibliography:** A list of all sources consulted.
    
- **Index:** An alphabetical listing of names, places, and topics with page numbers. It acts as a guide for the reader.
    

## Types of Report

1. **Technical Report:** Used when a full written report is required for record-keeping or public dissemination.
    
2. **Popular Report:** Used when research results have policy implications.
    

## Technical Report

The main emphasis is on the methods employed, assumptions made, and a detailed presentation of findings with their limitations and supporting data.

A general outline includes:

- **Summary of results:** A brief review of main findings.
    
- **Nature of the study:** Objectives, problem formulation, hypothesis, and analysis type.

## Oral Presentation

- Should be carefully prepared, keeping the audience in mind. A good presentation is not always a lengthy one.
    
- Carefully selected visual aids like graphs, tables, and charts can help. However, using too many visuals can be boring.
    
- Clear clarification is vital. The speaker should be patient, establish eye contact, and use effective body language and gestures.
    

## Mechanics of Writing a Research Report

- **Size of physical design:** Use unruled 8.5" x 11" paper, blue or black ink, have margins, and be double-spaced.
    
- **Layout:** Should be well-thought-out and appropriate for the objective and nature of the problem.
    
- **Treatment of quotations:** Use quotation marks. Short quotes are double-spaced; quotes longer than 4-5 lines are single-spaced.
    
- **Footnotes:** Used for cross-references, citations, acknowledgements, and explanations. They are placed at the bottom of the page, numbered consecutively, and single-spaced.
    
- **Documentation style:**
    
    - **Single-volume reference:** Author's name, title (underlined), place and date of publication, pagination.
        
    - **Multi-volume reference:** Include the volume number after the publication details.
