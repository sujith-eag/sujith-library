# Patent Law in India

Indian Patent Law is defined by the provisions of the Patents Act, 1970. This legislation governs patents in India and first came into force in 1972, building upon the original Indian Patents and Designs Act of 1911. Under the current law, patent rights are granted for inventions that are new, involve an inventive step, and are capable of industrial application. This can cover a process, a product, or an article of manufacture.

The Office of the Controller General of Patents, Designs, and Trade Marks (CGPDTM) is the body responsible for administering the Indian Patent Act. The Controller General supervises the Act’s implementation and advises the government on related matters.

The Patents Act has been amended several times, including in 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2006. These amendments were necessary to make the Act compliant with the TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) agreement. A major amendment in 2005 extended product patents to all fields of technology, including food, drugs, chemicals, and microorganisms.

#### Salient Features of the Law

- Extension of product patent protection to sectors like drugs, foods, and chemicals.
    
- The term for product patent protection is 20 years.
    
- Introduction of provisions for granting compulsory licenses for the export of medicines to countries with insufficient or no manufacturing capacity.
    

#### Effects of Patent Law

The government has proactively used tools like compulsory licensing to ensure low prices for essential drugs and keep exorbitant prices in check. The amendments aimed to make Indian pharmaceutical industries competitive with multinational companies. As a result, Indian companies manufacturing generic drugs have flourished, and many multinational corporations have opened research and development centers in India.

### Copyrights

Copyright has become a particularly important area of intellectual property law in recent times due to digitalization. In the digital era, protecting information and databases is crucial. It is important to understand the differences between the rights of various creators, such as authors, performers, and musicians, as this is where violations most often occur.

#### Copyright Controversies

Copyright violation is a serious issue with significant consequences. For example, a college lecturer admitted to copying a poet's work, and a Vice-Chancellor of Delhi University was jailed for allegedly copying parts of a student's thesis.

These cases highlight key principles:

- Copyright is not simply the "right to copy."
    
- It is a complex "bundle of rights."
    
- Violation can lead to severe penalties, including imprisonment.
    

#### Introduction to Copyright

Copyright provides free and automatic protection for an author's original expression of ideas once they are captured in a specific medium, such as in a written or recorded format. There is no need to register for copyright; it is granted automatically when you write a poem, a book, or an article.

The most common works protected by copyright include books, films, music, artwork, newspapers, and sound recordings. It also extends to typographical arrangements, databases, computer programs, and compilations like academic journals. The scope of copyright covers a wide range of literary and artistic works, including:

- Books and lectures
    
- Dramatic and musical works
    
- Choreography and cinematography
    
- Drawings, paintings, and sculptures
    
- Photographs, maps, and sketches
    

#### Rights Under Copyright

Copyright includes two main types of rights:

- **Moral Rights:** These include the author's right of paternity (the right to be identified as the author). These rights are non-alienable, meaning they cannot be sold or transferred. Even if you assign the copyright to a publisher, you continue to be recognized as the author of the work.
    
- **Economic Rights:** These are the rights to exploit the work for economic benefit. They include rights to performance and translation. Unlike moral rights, economic rights can be transferred, assigned, or licensed like any other property. These rights always belong to the owner of the copyright.
    

#### Who are the Authors?

Under copyright law, the "author" can be:

- The writer of a book.
    
- The painter of a picture.
    
- The music composer.
    
- The translator.
    
- The cinematographer.
    
- The photographer.
    

#### Duration of Protection

The duration of copyright protection is significantly longer than for other forms of IP.

- **Copyrights:** The TRIPS agreement prescribes a minimum of 50 years for books and cinematographic works, and 25 years for photographic works.
    
- **Patents:** 20 years.
    
- **Trademarks & Geographical Indications:** 10 years (can be renewed).
    

#### Copyright Registration Procedure in India

Step 1: File an Application

The author, claimant, or owner of the work can file an application physically at the copyrights office, by post, or online. A separate application with the requisite fee is required for each work. Application fees vary by the type of work (e.g., ₹500 for an artistic work, ₹5,000 for a cinematograph film) and can range from ₹5,000 to ₹40,000. Payment can be made via demand draft, Indian postal order, or e-payment.

Step 2: Examination

After an application is filed and a dairy number is issued, there is a mandatory 30-day waiting period. During this time, the application is reviewed by a copyright examiner, and it is open for public objections.

- **Case 1: No Objections Raised:** If there are no objections, the examiner scrutinizes the application for any discrepancies. If the application is complete and correct, it proceeds to the next step. If discrepancies are found, a letter is sent to the applicant, and a hearing may be conducted. Once the issue is resolved, the application moves forward.
    
- **Case 2: Objections Raised:** If an objection is filed, letters are sent to both parties, who are then called for a hearing before the registrar. If the objection is rejected, the application proceeds to scrutiny as described above. If the objection is upheld or the discrepancy is not resolved, the application is rejected, and the process ends for the applicant.
    

Step 3: Registration

The registrar may ask for additional documents. Once the registrar is fully satisfied with the claim, the details of the copyright are entered into the Register of Copyrights, and a certificate of registration is issued. The process is complete when the applicant receives the Extracts of the Register of Copyrights (ROC).
