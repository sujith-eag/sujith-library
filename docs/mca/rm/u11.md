>Define Objectives of Research and their types

Research objectives are precise statements that define the goals of a research study. They clarify what the research aims to achieve.

- To find answers to questions through scientific procedures.
    
- To discover hidden truths not yet identified.

### Types of Research Objectives

1. **General Objectives**: Broad aims describing the main purpose of the study to provide an overview of the research aim.  
    * To explore the relationship between exercise and mental health.
    
2. **Specific Objectives**: Break down general objectives into smaller and more focused goals to guide data collection and analysis.
    - To assess exercise frequency among young adults.
    - To evaluate the impact of different exercises on anxiety.
    
3. **Descriptive Objectives**: Describe characteristics or phenomena without investigating cause-effect relationships.  
    * To describe the demographics of rural clinic patients.

4. **Explanatory Objectives**: Identify cause-effect relationships.  
    * To determine how income level affects purchasing behavior.

5. **Exploratory Objectives**: Investigate poorly understood phenomena. Often used in preliminary or Qualitative research  
    * To explore challenges in online education for teachers.
    
6. **Evaluative Objectives**: Assess effectiveness or outcome of a program or policy. 
    * To evaluate the impact of a workplace wellness program on productivity.
    
## Types of Research

>[!caution] Question
>Differentiate Between :
>* Descriptive and Analytical Research
>* Applied and Fundamental Research
>* Quantitative and Qualitative Research
>* Conceptual and Empirical Research

### 1. Descriptive Vs Analytical Research

#### Descriptive Research :

- It Focuses on describing current conditions or phenomena at present.

* It can answer what, where, when and how questions, but not why questions.
	
* It includes surveys and fact-finding inquiries of different kinds.
	* Business surveys on customer preferences.

#### Analytical Research :

* Researcher has to use facts or information already available, and analyze these to make critical evaluation of the material.

- Involves using existing data for critical evaluation.
	* Analyzing sales data to improve marketing strategies.
	* A retail company using analytical research to enhance its marketing strategies. They gather extensive data on consumer behavior, purchase history, website interactions, and demographic information.

### 2. Applied Vs Fundamental

#### Applied Research :

Applied research is more concerned with knowledge that has immediate application and would be useful in making decisions and formulating policies. It is deductive in nature that means it keeps some theories as its base while conducting research.

- Solves practical, real-world problems.
- Deductive and quantitative in nature.
	- _Example_: Studying consumer response to a new product.

#### Fundamental Research :

Fundamental research is inductive in nature that means it comes with new theory discoveries.

Fundamental research is also called basic or pure research, it is concerned with the development, examination, verification and refinement of research methods, procedures, techniques and tools that form the body of research methodology.

Fundamental research is qualitative in nature. The professors generally carry out fundamental research and it is used for future benefits.

- Develops new theories or knowledge.
- Inductive and qualitative in nature.	
	- Researching theories of human motivation.

### 3. Quantitative Vs Qualitative
#### Quantitative Research :

It is a systematic investigation that primarily focuses on quantifying data, variables, and relationships. It involves the use of statistical, mathematical, and computational techniques to collect and analyze data.

Quantitative research is often used to establish patterns, test hypotheses, and make predictions.

- Focuses on numerical data and statistical analysis.
	* Survey on student performance using test scores.
	* It is widely applied in fields such as psychology, sociology, economics, health sciences, and education. 

#### Qualitative Research :

Qualitative research is a method of inquiry that seeks to understand human experiences, behaviors, and interactions by exploring them in-depth. It is concerned with qualitative phenomenon.

- Explores subjective experiences and meanings.
	* Interviewing patients about their hospital experience.
	* Investigating the reasons for human behavior.

### 4. Conceptual Vs Empirical

#### Conceptual Research :

Conceptual Research involves theorizing and synthesizing ideas and concepts without direct observation or experimentation. It is related to some abstract idea or theory, and used to develop new concepts or to reinterpret existing one. 

It includes analytical and interpretative methods, including literature review, theoretical synthesis, and logical reasoning.

- Based on abstract ideas and theories.
	* Theoretical models in economics or philosophy.
	* Developing theories of philosophy, Mathematics and Economics
	* Formulating new economic or mathematical models based on existing data

#### Empirical Research :

Empirical research involves direct observation, experimentation, and the collection of measurable evidence. It generates new, primary data; 

It involves active data collection, including using instruments and measurements to gather new data. Relies on measurable and observable data.

Experimental methods : controlled experiments, surveys, observations, and statistical analysis.

- Based on observation or experimentation.
	* Observing behavioral changes in response to a new educational method.
	* Conducting clinical trials to test a new drug.

## Research Approaches

>[!caution] Question
>Define Research approaches and it's Importance

Research approach is a plan or strategy for conducting research, guiding how data is collected, analyzed, and interpreted, to answer research questions or test hypotheses.

**Importance of Research Approach:**
* **Alignment** : Matches research questions with appropriate methods.

* **Clarity** : Ensures a systematic and focused study design.

* **Flexibility** : Allows adaptation to different types of research objectives.

* **Reliability** : Enhances the validity and replicability of findings.


### Types of Research Approaches

>[!caution] Question
>Explain Different types of Research approaches

#### 1. Qualitative Research Approach

The qualitative approach focuses on understanding phenomena through in-depth exploration and subjective analysis. It emphasizes meanings, experiences, and interpretations rather than numerical measurements.

* Focuses on meanings, experiences, and interpretations.
	* Understanding patient experiences in healthcare settings.
	* Analyzing themes in literary texts.

Methods : Interviews, Focus groups, Content analysis.

Characteristics:
* Non-numerical data.
* Open-ended and flexible.
* Context-driven analysis.

#### 2. Quantitative Research Approach

The quantitative approach focuses on measuring variables and analyzing data using statistical methods. It is characterized by structured and objective inquiry.

- Involves numerical data and statistical analysis.
	* Measuring the impact of a new teaching method on student performance.
	* Analyzing market trends using survey data.

Characteristics:
* Numerical data.
* Hypothesis-driven.
* Statistical analysis.

Methods:
