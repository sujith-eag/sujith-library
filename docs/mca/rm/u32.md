# Data Collection

The process of data collection starts after a research problem has been defined and a research plan has been created. A researcher must decide whether to use primary or secondary data.

- **Primary Data**: This is data collected for the first time, making it original in character. The collection of this data is an original process.
    
- **Secondary Data**: This is data that has already been collected and processed by someone else. Collecting this type of data is a matter of compilation.
    
The choice between primary and secondary data will determine the collection method a researcher uses.

### Experiments vs. Surveys

**An experiment** is an investigation where a factor or variable is isolated and its effects are measured. The investigator intentionally conducts the experiment and measures its effects.

**A survey** is a method of securing information about a phenomenon from all or a selected number of respondents within the concerned universe. The investigator examines phenomena that exist independently of their actions.

#### Difference between Surveys and Experiments

- **Research Type:** Surveys are used in descriptive research, while experiments are part of experimental research.
    
- **Sample Size:** Surveys usually require larger samples due to potentially low response rates (as low as 20-30% in mailed questionnaire studies). Experiments generally need smaller samples.
    
- **Focus:** Surveys are concerned with describing, recording, analyzing, and interpreting existing or past conditions. Experimental research provides a systematic method for answering "what will happen if this is done" when certain variables are controlled or manipulated.
    
- **Field of Application:** Surveys are appropriate for social and behavioral sciences. Experiments are essential features of physical and natural sciences.
    
- **Research Environment:** Surveys are a form of field research, whereas experiments are typically laboratory research.
    
- **Hypothesis:** Surveys are concerned with formulating and testing hypotheses by analyzing the relationship between non-manipulated variables. Experimentation provides a method for testing a proposed hypothesis after defining a problem.
    
- **Classification:** Surveys can be census or sample surveys and may be classified as social, economic, or public opinion surveys. Data collection methods include observation, interviews, or questionnaires.
    
## Collection of Primary Data

Primary data is collected during experiments in experimental research. In descriptive research and surveys (both sample and census), primary data can be obtained through observation, direct communication with respondents (like personal interviews), or other methods.

Important methods for collecting primary data, particularly in surveys and descriptive research, include:

- Observation method
    
- Interview method
    
- Through questionnaires
    
- Through schedules
    
- Other methods such as:
    
    - Warranty cards
        
    - Distributor audits
        
    - Pantry audits
        
    - Consumer panels
        
    - Using mechanical devices
        
    - Projective techniques
        
    - Depth interviews
        
    - Content analysis
        
## Observation Method

The observation method is commonly used, especially in behavioral sciences. While we all observe things around us, scientific observation is systematically planned, recorded, and subjected to checks for validity and reliability to serve a formulated research purpose. The investigator seeks information through their own direct observation without asking the respondent. For example, in a consumer behavior study, the investigator might look at the respondent's watch instead of asking for the brand.

**Advantages:**

- Eliminates subjective bias if done accurately.
    
- The information relates to current happenings, not complicated by past behavior or future intentions.
    
- It is independent of the respondent's willingness to respond and is less demanding of their active cooperation.
    
- Particularly suitable for studies involving subjects who cannot give verbal reports of their feelings.
    

**Limitations:**

- It is an expensive method.
    
- The information provided is very limited.
    
- Unforeseen factors can interfere with the observation.
    
- Some people are rarely accessible to direct observation, creating obstacles.
    

### Types of Observation:

- **Structured vs. Unstructured Observation:**
    
    - **Structured observation** involves a careful definition of units to be observed, a standardized style of recording, and selection of pertinent data. It is appropriate for descriptive studies.
        
    - **Unstructured observation** takes place without these predefined characteristics and is more likely to be used in an exploratory study.
        
- **Participant vs. Non-participant Observation:**
    
    - **Participant observation:** The observer becomes a member of the group being observed to experience what its members experience. This allows the researcher to record natural behavior and gather information that might not be otherwise available. However, the observer may lose objectivity and their range of experience may be narrowed.
        
    - **Non-participant observation:** The observer acts as a detached emissary without participating in the group's life.
        
    - **Disguised observation:** The observer's presence is unknown to the people being observed.
        
- **Controlled vs. Uncontrolled Observation:**
    
    - **Uncontrolled observation:** Takes place in a natural setting. Its aim is to get a spontaneous picture of life and persons. The main pitfall is subjective interpretation.
        
    - **Controlled observation:** Takes place according to pre-arranged plans, often involving experimental procedures and the use of mechanical or precision instruments for accuracy and standardization. It tends to supply formalized data for generalizations.
