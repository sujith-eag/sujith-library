# Research Databases in Literature Review

Conducting a comprehensive literature review necessitates the use of reputable research databases to identify high-quality, peer-reviewed sources. 

## Key Research Databases for Literature Reviews

**1.1. Google Scholar**

- **Pros:** Offers broad, interdisciplinary coverage and a user-friendly interface.
    
- **Cons:** Search results may include non-peer-reviewed sources; filtering capabilities are less refined than specialized databases.
    
- **Best for:** Preliminary searches and citation tracking ("cited by" features).
    

**1.2. JSTOR**

- **Pros:** Provides access to high-quality, full-text academic journal articles and books, with strong collections in the humanities.
    
- **Cons:** Often has a "moving wall" or embargo period, meaning the most recent issues (last 1-5 years) may not be available.
    
- **Best for:** Literature, history, philosophy, and social sciences.
    

**1.3. PubMed**

- **Pros:** A comprehensive database for biomedical and health-related fields, maintained by the U.S. National Library of Medicine.
    
- **Cons:** Highly specialized and generally not suitable for research in the humanities.
    
- **Best for:** Health sciences, medicine, and psychology.
    

**1.4. Scopus**

- **Pros:** A large, multidisciplinary database with sophisticated citation analysis tools.
    
- **Cons:** Requires an institutional subscription for full access; the interface can be complex.
    
- **Best for:** Sciences, social sciences, and engineering.
    

**1.5. Web of Science (Clarivate)**

- **Pros:** Features comprehensive indexing of high-impact journals and powerful citation tracking capabilities.
    
- **Cons:** Access is typically restricted to institutional subscribers.
    
- **Best for:** Identifying foundational and influential research across all major disciplines.
    

**1.6. ERIC (Education Resources Information Center)**

- **Pros:** The primary database for scholarly literature in the field of education.
    
- **Cons:** Its scope is limited exclusively to educational topics.
    
- **Best for:** Research on educational theory, policy, and practice.
    

**1.7. PsycINFO (American Psychological Association)**

- **Pros:** The authoritative resource for peer-reviewed literature in psychology and behavioral sciences.
    
- **Cons:** Requires a subscription for access.
    
- **Best for:** Psychology, neuroscience, and behavioral sciences.
    

**1.8. Project MUSE**

- **Pros:** Contains a curated collection of scholarly journals and books from non-profit university presses and societies.
    
- **Cons:** Content is heavily focused on the humanities and social sciences, lacking broader scientific coverage.
    
- **Best for:** Literature, cultural studies, and history.
    

**1.9. ProQuest**

- **Pros:** Offers extensive access to dissertations, theses, and a wide array of peer-reviewed journals.
    
- **Cons:** The interface can vary, and some content may be behind a paywall depending on the institutional subscription.
    
- **Best for:** Interdisciplinary research and accessing grey literature (e.g., dissertations).
    

**1.10. EBSCOhost**

- **Pros:** A platform that hosts numerous subject-specific databases (e.g., MLA International Bibliography, Academic Search Premier).
    
- **Cons:** Access is dependent on an institutional login; navigating to the correct sub-database can be required.
    
- **Best for:** General and subject-specific academic research.
    

## Strategies for Using Research Databases

- **Utilize Boolean Operators:** Refine search queries by combining keywords with operators such as `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` to narrow or broaden results.
    
- **Apply Filters:** Use built-in filters to sort results by publication date, document type (e.g., article, review), and subject area.
    
- **Employ Citation Tracking:** Leverage features in databases like Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science to find articles that cite a key paper (forward tracking) or that are cited by it (backward tracking).
    
- **Manage Citations:** Export citation data to reference management software such as EndNote, Zotero, or Mendeley to maintain organization.
    
- **Verify Full-Text Access:** Check for full-text availability through your institution’s subscriptions, interlibrary loan services, or open-access repositories.
    
## Using Web-Based Sources in a Literature Review

Web sources include websites, online reports, blogs, news articles, organizational web pages, and government portals. This category is distinct from peer-reviewed journal articles accessed electronically, which are considered scholarly sources.

#### Appropriate Use of Web Sources

- To obtain recent information not yet published in scholarly literature (e.g., current statistics, policy updates).
    
- To cite official reports or data from reputable organizations (e.g., World Health Organization, United Nations, government departments).
    
- To provide background context on emerging topics where peer-reviewed literature is still scarce.
    
#### Criteria for Evaluating Web Sources

- **Authority:** Assess the credentials and reputation of the author or organization.
    
- **Accuracy:** Verify that the information is supported by evidence, data, or references.
    
- **Currency:** Check the publication or last updated date to ensure the information is current.
    
- **Purpose:** Determine if the source is objective or if it exhibits bias (e.g., commercial, political).
    
- **Domain:** Prioritize sources from government (`.gov`), educational (`.edu`), or established organizational (`.org`) domains.
    
#### Guidelines for Citing Web Sources

- Provide a complete citation, including the URL and the date the content was accessed.
    
- Prioritize primary web sources (original reports or data) over secondary summaries.
    
- Use web sources judiciously, primarily to supplement and support the peer-reviewed literature.
    
#### Examples of Reputable Web Sources

- Government agencies (e.g., Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institutes of Health (NIH))
    
- International bodies (e.g., World Health Organization (WHO), UNESCO)
    
- Official websites of research institutes and academic institutions
    
- Websites of professional organizations (e.g., American Medical Association)
    

## Methodological Approach to Searching the Web

1. **Define the Research Question:** Begin with a clearly articulated research question. Identify specific keywords, phrases, and relevant synonyms to guide the search.
    
2. **Prioritize Academic Search Engines and Databases:** Start with scholarly databases like Google Scholar, PubMed, or JSTOR. These platforms are indexed with high-quality, peer-reviewed sources.
    
3. **Incorporate Reliable Web Sources Strategically:** When expanding the search, target credible websites such as those from governments (`.gov`), educational institutions (`.edu`), and major international organizations (`.org`).
    
4. **Apply Advanced Search Techniques:** Refine search results by using quotation marks for exact phrases (e.g., `"climate change impact"`), Boolean operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`), and site-specific searches (e.g., `site:.gov "renewable energy"`).
    
5. **Evaluate Source Credibility:** Critically assess each source by examining author credentials, checking for citations that support its claims, and confirming the publication date for relevance.
    
6. **Organize and Document Findings:** Maintain a systematic record of sources, including URLs, authors, and publication dates. Use reference management tools to organize citations.
    
7. **Synthesize Information:** Compare findings across all sources to identify consensus, discrepancies, and major themes. Note any gaps in the existing literature that may warrant further research.
