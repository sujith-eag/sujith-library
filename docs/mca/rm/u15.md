# Research Problem

A Research Problem is a question that a researcher wants to answer or a problem that a researcher wants to solve.

Any question that seeks an answer, or any assumption or assertion that needs to be challenged or investigated, can form the basis of a research problem.

Formulating a Research Problem:
1. Selecting the problem
2. Necessity of defining the problem
3. Techniques involved in defining a problem


## 1. Selecting the Problem

**Selecting the Problem** is the initial and crucial step in the research process, determining the direction and feasibility of the entire study. It is akin to identifying a destination before embarking on a journey; without a clear destination, a clear and economical plan is impossible. The quality and relevance of a research project are entirely dependent upon how well the research problem is formulated.

When selecting a research problem or topic, a researcher should consider several factors:

- **Avoid Overdone Subjects**.
- **Avoid Controversial Subjects**.
- **Avoid Too Narrow or Too Vague Problems**.
- **Subject should be Familiar and Feasible**.
- **Importance of the Subject and Researcher Qualifications** is a key criterion. The research should be relevant, adding to existing knowledge, bridging gaps, or being useful for policy formulation.
- **Cost and Time are Major Factors** : Availability of financial resources and time will influence the scope and methods of the research.
- A preliminary study or pilot survey is advisable, especially when the field of inquiry is relatively new or lacks well-developed techniques.

Characteristics of Good Topic:

1. **Interesting** – keeps the researcher interested in it throughout the research process.

2. **Re-searchable** – The problem must be capable of being investigated through the collection and analysis of data.

3. **Significant** – Good research should contribute to the existing body of knowledge, bridge current gaps, or be useful for policy formulation and practice.

4. **Manageable** – fits the level of researcher’s level of research skills, needed resources, and time restrictions.

5. **Ethical** – ensuring it does not embarrass, harm, or adversely affect participants.

## 2. Necessity of Defining a Problem

A properly defined research problem is crucial because it helps to **discriminate relevant data from irrelevant ones**. An ill-defined problem can lead to obstacles in the research process.

Some questions crop up in the mind of the researcher.
* What data are to be collected?
* What characteristics of data are relevant and need to be studied?
* What relations are to be explored?
* What techniques are to be used for the purpose?

The definition of the problem determines the data to be collected, the characteristics of relevant data, the relationships to be explored, the choice of techniques for exploration, and the final report's form.

## 3. Technique Involved in Defining a Problem

Defining a research problem properly and clearly is a crucial part of a research study.
1. General Statement of the problem
2. Understanding the nature of the problem
3. Surveying the available literature
4. Developing the ideas through discussions
5. Rephrasing the research problem into a working proposition
6. Operational Definitions
#### 1. Statement of the problem in a general way

Start by stating the problem in a broad, general way, immersing oneself in the subject matter. 

This might involve preliminary observations or pilot surveys in social research. Ambiguities in this general statement must be resolved through careful thought.

Pilot study - test, trial, experiment, trial run, dry run, experimental study, experimental investigation.

#### 2. Understanding the Nature of the Problem

For a better understanding of the nature of the problem involved, the researcher should
* Know its origin and nature clearly.
* Discuss with those who have a good knowledge of the problem concerned or similar other problems.
* Know about the environment within which the problem is to be studied and understood.

#### 3. Surveying Available Literature

An extensive literature review is essential to become familiar with relevant theories, reports, and previous studies. This helps in understanding what has already been done, identifying gaps in knowledge, and informing the selection of research methodology.

#### 4. Developing Ideas through Discussions (Experience Survey)

Discussing the problem with colleagues and experienced individuals can generate new ideas and provide insights into practical aspects. This helps to sharpen the focus on specific aspects of the study.

#### 5. Rephrasing the Research Problem into a Working Proposition

Finally, the broad problem is rephrased into analytical or operational terms, making it as specific as possible. This facilitates the development of working hypotheses.

#### 6. Operational Definitions

Key terms, concepts, and the study population used in the research problem must be clearly defined in measurable terms (operational definitions) to avoid ambiguity and ensure a uniform understanding among readers and respondents. 

For example, defining "poverty line" or "young person" for a study.
