# IMRaD in Scholarly Publishing

IMRaD is a standard format used in scientific writing and publications. The acronym stands for **I**ntroduction, **M**aterials and Methods, **R**esults, and **D**iscussion. This concise and professional format helps researchers present their ideas clearly and supports reviewers in evaluating the significance of the manuscript. By providing a clear internal structure, the IMRaD format fosters objective and reproducible science.

The full structure of a research paper also includes a Title, Authors, Keywords, Abstract, Conclusion, References, Acknowledgments, and Appendices. The IMRaD structure is particularly useful for improving skimming and scanning, allowing readers to locate specific information without reading the entire article. While it provides a logical flow for the final paper, this format does not follow the actual chronological process of conducting research. Researchers should always consult the specific instructions of their target journal before finalizing a manuscript.

## IMRaD Structure and Writing Order

A common approach to writing a paper using the IMRaD structure is:

1. **Materials and Methods:** This section can be written first, while the experiment is being conducted.
    
2. **Results:** Statistical analyses of the data are presented here to provide an understanding of the study's impact.
    
3. **Introduction:** This section is often written after the experiment, as it can then include a brief overview of the methods and data.
    
4. **Discussion:** Based on the results, this section interprets the findings. Acknowledging research weaknesses is also a major component.
    
5. **Conclusion:** This should describe the main conclusions from the research and their impact.
    
6. **Title:** It's often helpful to write a few potential titles and then select and refine the best one.
    
7. **Abstract:** This part is written last, as it must be based on all the previous sections.
    

## Citation and Acknowledgment in Research


### Citation in Research

A "citation" is how you inform your readers that certain material in your work originated from another source. It also provides the necessary information for readers to locate that source in your reference list. A proper in-text citation, often enclosed in parentheses, is essential to avoid accusations of plagiarism.

**Why should you cite sources?**

- To give proper credit to the original authors.
    
- To help the reader find more information about your topic and arguments.
    
- To strengthen your work by providing external support for your ideas.
    
- To avoid failing an assignment, a course, or being sued.
    

**When should you cite?**

- When you use the words, thoughts, or ideas of someone else.
    
- When you use a direct quote.
    
- When you reference an idea that has already been expressed.
    
- When another person's ideas or words have influenced your writing.
    

## Acknowledgment in Research

The acknowledgment section of a research project is where you show gratitude to the people or institutions that significantly contributed to your work. For example, you might thank your advisors for their guidance, colleagues for collaboration, librarians for their assistance, or a funding agency for financial support.

This section is typically placed at the beginning of a paper, after the abstract. It should be brief, to the point, and written in a formal, professional tone, avoiding casual language. You don't need to detail every contribution; a concise thank you is sufficient.

**Steps for writing an acknowledgment:**

1. Start by thanking those who directly supported your research, such as advisors and colleagues.
    
2. Mention any funding agencies that provided financial support.
    
3. Thank librarians or other research staff who provided assistance.
    
4. Include any other individuals who helped, such as lab assistants or research participants.
    

## Plagiarism in Research

Plagiarism means using someone else's work—their words, ideas, or information—without giving them proper credit through correct citation.

**Examples of Plagiarism:**

- Copying parts of a text word-for-word without using quotation marks.
    
- Paraphrasing a text by changing a few words or the sentence structure without citing the source.
    
- Giving incorrect information about a source.
    
- Quoting so much from one source that it makes up the majority of your text.
    
- Reusing your own work from a previous assignment without citing yourself (self-plagiarism).
    
### Types of Plagiarism:

- **Global plagiarism:** Passing off an entire text from someone else as your own.
    
- **Verbatim plagiarism:** Directly copying and pasting someone else's words without attribution.
    
- **Paraphrasing plagiarism:** Rephrasing someone's ideas to present them as your own without citation.
    
- **Patchwork plagiarism:** Stitching together parts from different sources to create your text without properly citing each one.
    
- **Self-plagiarism:** Recycling your own previously submitted work and presenting it as new.
    

## Reproducibility and Accountability in Research

### Reproducibility in Research

Reproducibility refers to instances where a researcher's original data and computer code can be used to regenerate their results. It can also refer to independent researchers arriving at the same results using their own data and methods. The focus is on validating the scientific claim. It is a minimum standard for any scientific study and requires transparency of methods, data, and code.

**Steps to make research reproducible include:**

- Creating a study plan and a pre-analysis plan.
    
- Documenting everything and keeping track of changes.
    
- Using informative naming conventions for files and folders.
    
- Having a clear Data Management Plan.
    
- Properly reporting both exploratory and confirmatory analysis.
    

## Accountability in Research

Accountability is a central issue in ethics, related to concepts like responsibility and integrity. In ethics, individuals are held accountable for their actions. Research accountability refers to the philosophies, policies, procedures, and standards used to promote and analyze ethical conduct in research.

The term also has roots in finance and business, where it relates to maintaining financial records and auditing them for accuracy. The attempt to adapt these methods to scientific research is known as data auditing (DA) and is a key part of ensuring accountability.

Accountability in research requires reviewing institutional policies, which set the tone for research conduct, and examining the attitudes and behavior of researchers. Society demands accountability from researchers, especially when their results affect individuals and communities. In the 21st century, it remains an important and growing area of interest for both professionals and the public.
