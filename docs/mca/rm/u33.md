# Data Collection

Data collection is a crucial step in the research process, commencing after a research problem has been clearly defined and a research design/plan has been established. Researchers must decide whether to gather **primary data** or utilize **secondary data** for their study.

**Primary data** refers to information collected for the first time, making it original in character. This type of data is gathered specifically for the current research purpose, either by the researcher themselves or by someone else on their behalf. The collection of primary data is an original process.

**Methods of Collecting Primary Data**:
1. **Observation Method**
2. **Interview Method**
    - **Structured Interviews**
    - **Unstructured Interviews**
3. **Questionnaires**
    - **Structured Questionnaires**
    - **Unstructured Questionnaires**
4. **Schedules**
5. **Other Methods**: warranty cards, distributor audits, pantry audits, consumer panels, mechanical devices, projective techniques, and depth interviews.
    
**Secondary data** refers to information that has already been collected and processed by someone else for purposes other than the current study. This type of data collection involves compilation rather than original generation.

**Sources of Secondary Data**: Secondary data can be published or unpublished:

- **Published Sources**: Government or semi-government publications (e.g., census, vital statistics, labor force surveys, health reports, economic forecasts), technical and trade journals, books, magazines, newspapers, reports from various associations (business, industry, banks), and reports by research scholars or universities.
- **Unpublished Sources**: Diaries, letters, unpublished biographies and autobiographies, and data available with scholars, research workers, trade associations, and public/private organizations.

## Experiments vs. Surveys

**An experiment** is an investigation where a factor or variable is isolated and its effects are measured. The investigator intentionally conducts the experiment and measures its effects.

**A survey** is a method of securing information about a phenomenon from all or a selected number of respondents within the concerned universe. The investigator examines phenomena that exist independently of their actions.

### Difference between Surveys and Experiments

#### Research Type: 
- **Surveys** are primarily employed in **descriptive research studies**, which focus on describing the current state of affairs, conditions that exist or existed.

- **Experiments** are an integral part of **experimental research studies** (also known as hypothesis-testing research), which aim to clarify cause-and-effect relationships.

#### Sample Size
- **Surveys** typically require **larger samples** because the percentage of responses can be low(as low as 20–30%). 

- **Experiments** generally need **smaller samples**.
 
#### Focus: 
* Surveys are concerned with describing, recording, analyzing, and interpreting existing or past conditions. 

* Experimental research provides a systematic method for answering "what will happen if this is done" when certain variables are controlled or manipulated.

#### Field of Application: 
- **Surveys** are generally more appropriate for the **social and behavioral sciences**, as many types of human behavior that researchers are interested in cannot be realistically arranged or controlled in an experimental setting.

- **Experiments** are an essential feature of the **physical and natural sciences**, where strict control over conditions can often be enforced, typically in a laboratory environment.

#### Research Environment: 
- **Surveys** are examples of **field research**, conducted in natural settings.

- **Experiments** generally constitute **laboratory research**, although they can also be carried out in natural environments depending on the study design.

#### Hypothesis Testing
- **Surveys** are used for **hypothesis formulation and testing** by analyzing relationships between variables that are observed but not manipulated.

- **Experimentation** directly provides a method for **testing a proposed hypothesis**. After defining a problem, experimenters propose a hypothesis, then test it and either confirm or disconfirm it.
    
## Collection of Primary Data

The choice of a primary data collection method depends on factors such as the study's purpose, available resources, researcher's skills, and the socioeconomic-demographic characteristics of the study population.

Here are the important methods for collecting primary data, particularly in surveys and descriptive research:
- Observation method 
- Interview method
- Through questionnaires
- Through schedules
- Other methods such as: Warranty cards, Distributor audits, Pantry audits, Consumer panels, Using mechanical devices, Projective techniques, Depth interviews, Content analysis
        
## 1. Observation Method

This method involves the investigator's direct observation of phenomena without questioning respondents. It is a purposeful, systematic, and selective way of watching and listening to interactions or phenomena as they occur.

It is most appropriate when researchers are more interested in behavior than in individuals' perceptions, or when respondents cannot provide objective information. It's useful for studying group interactions, dietary patterns, worker functions, or individual behavior/personality traits.

**Advantages:**
- Eliminates subjective bias if done accurately.
    
- The information relates to current happenings, not complicated by past behavior or future intentions.
    
- It is independent of the respondent's willingness to respond and is less demanding of their active cooperation.
    
- Particularly suitable for studies involving subjects who cannot give verbal reports of their feelings.
    

**Limitations:**

- Respondents may alter their behavior if aware they are being observed.
- Interpretations can vary among observers.
- There is a possibility of incomplete observation or recording.
- It can be an expensive method and provides limited information.
- Subjective interpretation is a pitfall in non-controlled observation.
- Unforeseen factors can interfere with the observation.
- Some people are rarely accessible to direct observation, creating obstacles.
    

### Types of Observation:

#### Structured vs. Unstructured Observation:
    
- **Structured observation** involves a careful definition of units to be observed, a standardized style of recording, and selection of pertinent data. It is appropriate for descriptive studies.
	
- **Unstructured observation** Occurs without pre-arranged characteristics, aiming for a spontaneous picture of life and individuals. It is more likely used in **exploratory studies**..
        
#### Participant vs. Non-participant Observation:
    
- **Participant observation:** The researcher actively participates in the group's activities, observing and recording natural behavior, and sometimes gaining information that would otherwise be unobtainable. It's predominantly a **qualitative research design**.
	
- **Non-participant observation:** The researcher remains a passive observer, watching and listening without involvement.
	
- **Disguised observation:** The researcher's presence is unknown to the people being observed.
	
#### Controlled vs. Uncontrolled Observation:
    
- **Uncontrolled observation:** Takes place in a natural setting. Its aim is to get a spontaneous picture of life and persons. The main pitfall is subjective interpretation.
	
- **Controlled observation:** Takes place according to pre-arranged plans, often involving experimental procedures and the use of mechanical or precision instruments for accuracy and standardization. It tends to supply formalized data for generalizations.
        

## 2. Interview Method

An interview is a **person-to-person interaction with a specific purpose** in mind, where an interviewer asks questions and records the responses. This interaction can be face-to-face or conducted via telephone or other electronic media. 

### Personal Interviews:

An interviewer asks questions in a face-to-face contact. This can be a direct personal investigation, where the interviewer collects information personally from the sources, or an indirect oral investigation, where the interviewer cross-examines other people who have knowledge about the problem. 

Direct investigation is suitable for intensive studies, while indirect investigation is often used by government-appointed commissions and committees.

- **Structured Interviews:** Utilizes a **predetermined set of questions** with highly standardized recording techniques. The interviewer follows a **rigid procedure**, asking questions in a prescribed form and order. Questions can be either open-ended or closed, as specified in the **interview schedule**. This method is economical and provides a safe basis for generalization.
    
- **Unstructured Interviews:** are characterized by **flexibility** in approach to questioning, content, and structure. The interviewer has considerable freedom to ask **supplementary questions**, omit some questions, or change their sequence as needed. This flexibility makes comparing interviews difficult and analysis more time-consuming. It is a central technique in exploratory or formulative research studies.
    
- **Other Types of Interviews:**
    
    - **Focussed interview:** Focuses on a given experience of the respondent and its effects. The interviewer has the freedom to decide the manner and sequence of questions and to explore reasons and motives.
        
    - **Clinical interview:** These interviews are concerned with **broad underlying feelings or motivations** or the course of an individual's life experience.
        
    - **Non-directive interview:** The interviewer encourages the respondent to talk about a topic with minimal direct questioning, acting as a catalyst.
        
#### Merits of the Interview Method:

- **More information and that too in greater depth can be obtained**.

- The interviewer, through their skill, **can overcome resistance from respondents**, and the interview method can yield an almost perfect sample of the general population.

- There is **greater flexibility**, especially in unstructured interviews, as there is always an opportunity to restructure questions.

- The **observation method can also be applied to recording verbal answers** to various questions.

- **Personal information can be obtained easily** under this method.

- Non-response generally remains very low.

- The **language of the interview can be adapted to the respondent's ability or educational level**, avoiding misinterpretations of questions.

- The interviewer can collect **supplementary information about the respondent’s personal characteristics and environment**, which is often valuable for interpreting results.

#### Demerits of the Interview Method:

- **It is very expensive**. This is especially true when a large and geographically spread sample is taken.

- There is a **possibility of bias** from both the interviewer and the respondent.

- Certain types of respondents, such as **important officials, executives, or high-income individuals, may not be easily approachable**, potentially leading to inadequate data.

- This method is **relatively more time-consuming**, especially with large samples and when follow-up calls are necessary.

- The presence of the interviewer on the spot may **over-stimulate the respondent**, sometimes leading to imaginary information to make the interview more interesting.

- The **organization required for selecting, training, and supervising field staff is more complex** with formidable problems.

- Interviewing can **introduce systematic errors**.

- **Effective interviewing presupposes proper rapport** with respondents to facilitate free and frank responses, which is often a difficult requirement.

- The **researcher may introduce their own bias** in framing questions and interpreting responses. 

#### Pre-requisites for Interviewing:

Interviewers should be carefully selected, trained, and briefed. They must be honest, sincere, hardworking, impartial, and have technical competence and practical experience. Field checks are necessary to ensure they are not deviating from instructions.

___

### Telephone Interviews:

Telephone interviews involve **contacting respondents via telephone to collect information**. While not the most widely used method, they play an important role, particularly in **industrial surveys in developed regions**.

#### Merits of Telephone Interviews:

- More flexible than mailing methods.
- Faster way of obtaining information, making it a quick method.
- Cheaper than personal interviewing methods, with a relatively low cost per response.
- Callbacks are simple and economical.
- Higher rate of response than mailing methods, with non-response generally remaining very low.
- Replies can be recorded without causing embarrassment to respondents.
- The interviewer can explain requirements more easily to the respondent.
- Access can be gained to respondents who otherwise cannot be contacted for various reasons.
- No field staff is required for direct, in-person interviews.
- Representative and wider distribution of the sample is possible.
- It can be a useful tool for follow-up to questionnaires.
 
#### Demerits of Telephone Interviews:

- Respondents have little time for considered answers, as the interview period is typically short, often not exceeding five minutes.
- Surveys are restricted to respondents who have telephone facilities, excluding those without access.
- Extensive geographical coverage may be restricted by cost considerations.
- Not suitable for intensive surveys where comprehensive answers are required for various questions.
- The possibility of interviewer bias is relatively more.
- Questions have to be short and to the point, and probes are difficult to handle effectively.


## Collection of Data Through Questionnaires

This popular method involves sending a questionnaire (a list of questions printed in a definite order) to people with a request to answer and return it. Respondents are expected to read, understand, and write down their replies in the provided space on their own.

#### Merits of Questionnaires:

- Low cost, even for a large and widely spread universe.
    
- Free from interviewer bias; answers are in the respondent's own words.
    
- Respondents have adequate time to give well-thought-out answers.
    
- Respondents who are not easily approachable can be reached conveniently.
    
- Large samples can be used, making results more dependable and reliable.
    
#### Demerits of Questionnaires:

- Low rate of return; bias due to non-response is often indeterminate.
    
- Can only be used with educated and cooperating respondents.
    
- Control over the questionnaire is lost once it is sent.
    
- Inflexible, as the approach cannot be amended after dispatch.
    
- Possibility of ambiguous or omitted replies.
    
- Difficult to know if willing respondents are truly representative.
    
- Likely to be the slowest method.
    

### Main Aspects of a Questionnaire:

A questionnaire should be very carefully constructed.

- **General Form:** Can be structured (definite, concrete, pre-determined questions in the same order) or unstructured. The form of questions can be closed (yes/no) or open (free response).
    
- **Question Sequence:** A proper sequence reduces the chance of misunderstanding. It should be clear and smooth-moving, with easier questions at the beginning to arouse interest and cooperation. Avoid opening with questions that strain memory, are of a personal character, or relate to personal wealth.
    
- **Question Formulation and Wording:** Each question must be very clear and impartial. Questions should be constructed as part of a well-thought-out tabulation plan. They should be simple, concrete, and conform to the respondent's way of thinking.
    
### Essentials of a Good Questionnaire:

- Should be comparatively short and simple.
    
- Questions should proceed in a logical sequence from easy to more difficult.
    
- Personal and intimate questions should be left to the end.
    
- Avoid technical terms and vague expressions.
    
- Questions can be dichotomous, multiple-choice, or open-ended (the latter should be used sparingly as they are hard to analyze).
    
- Should include some control questions to check the reliability of the respondent.
    

## Collection of Data Through Schedules

This method of data collection is very similar to collecting data through a questionnaire. The main difference is that schedules, which are proformas containing a set of questions, are filled out by specially appointed enumerators. 

These enumerators visit respondents, ask the questions from the proforma in the order they are listed, and record the replies in the designated space. 

In some cases, schedules may be given to respondents, and the enumerators assist them in recording their answers. Enumerators also explain the goals of the investigation and clarify any difficulties a respondent might have with a particular question or definition.

This method requires the careful selection and thorough training of enumerators so they understand the nature and scope of the investigation. Enumerators should be intelligent, capable of cross-examination to find the truth, honest, sincere, hardworking, and possess patience and perseverance. 

This method is highly useful for extensive inquiries and can produce reliable results. However, it is very expensive and is typically used in investigations by governmental agencies or large organizations. The population census around the world is conducted using this method.

### Key aspects of this method:

- **Enumerator Selection**: Enumerators must be selected very carefully. They should be intelligent, possess the ability to cross-examine to find the truth, and be honest, sincere, hardworking, patient, and persevering.
    
- **Training**: They must be well-trained and have the nature and scope of the investigation thoroughly explained to them.
    
- **Usefulness**: This method is highly useful for extensive inquiries and can produce reliable results.
    
- **Cost**: It is a very expensive method and is typically used for investigations conducted by government agencies or large organizations. The worldwide population census is conducted using this method.
    

### Difference Between Questionnaires and Schedules

- **Administration:** A questionnaire is usually mailed to informants to be answered without assistance. A schedule is filled out by a research worker or enumerator who can interpret questions if necessary.
    
- **Cost:** Collecting data via questionnaire is relatively cheap and economical, as costs are mainly for preparation and mailing. Data collection through schedules is more expensive due to the need to appoint and train enumerators.
    
- **Response Rate:** Non-response is often high for questionnaires. In contrast, non-response is generally very low for schedules since they are filled by enumerators. However, with schedules, there is a risk of interviewer bias and cheating.
    
- **Respondent Identity:** With a questionnaire, it's not always clear who is replying. With a schedule, the respondent's identity is known.
    
- **Speed:** The questionnaire method is often slow because many respondents do not return them in a timely manner. Information is collected promptly with schedules as they are filled by enumerators.
    
- **Personal Contact:** Personal contact is generally not possible with the questionnaire method. Direct personal contact is established when using schedules.
    
- **Respondent Requirements:** The questionnaire method can only be used with literate and cooperative respondents. Schedules can be used to gather information even if the respondents are illiterate.
    
- **Sample Distribution:** A wider and more representative sample distribution is possible with the questionnaire method. It can be difficult to send enumerators over a wide area for schedules.
    
- **Accuracy:** The risk of collecting incomplete and wrong information is higher with the questionnaire method. Information collected through schedules is generally more complete and accurate because enumerators can clarify questions for respondents.
    
- **Success Factor:** The success of the questionnaire method depends more on the quality of the questionnaire itself. For schedules, success relies heavily on the honesty and competence of the enumerators.
    
- **Appearance:** The physical appearance of a questionnaire must be attractive to get the respondent's attention. This is not as important for schedules, as they are filled in by enumerators.
    
- **Observation:** The observation method can be used in conjunction with schedules, but this is not possible when collecting data via questionnaires.
    

## Other Methods of Data Collection

Several other methods are used for data collection, particularly by large business houses.

- **Warranty Cards:** These are usually postal-sized cards that dealers of consumer durables use to collect product information. The card, which contains questions, is placed inside the product package with a request for the consumer to fill it out and mail it back.
    
- **Distributor or Store Audits:** These are performed by distributors and manufacturers through their salesmen at regular intervals to estimate market size, market share, and seasonal purchasing patterns. Data is obtained through observation or by copying store records, not by questioning. This method is efficient for evaluating the effect of in-store promotions on sales.
    
- **Pantry Audits:** This technique estimates the consumption of goods at the consumer level. An investigator inventories the types, quantities, and prices of commodities in a consumer's pantry. The goal is often to determine what types of consumers buy certain products and brands, assuming the pantry's contents accurately reflect preferences. These audits are often supplemented with direct questioning about purchasing habits.
    
- **Consumer Panels:** This is an extension of the pantry audit, where a set of consumers agrees to keep detailed daily records of their consumption, which are made available to the investigator.
    
    - **Transitory Consumer Panel:** This type is set up to measure the effect of a specific phenomenon, often on a before-and-after basis. It is a popular tool in advertising and social research.
        
    - **Continuing Consumer Panel:** This panel is set up for an indefinite period to collect data on a particular aspect of consumer behavior over time.
        
- **Use of Mechanical Devices:** Devices like eye cameras, pupilometric cameras, psychogalvanometers, motion picture cameras, and audiometers are widely used to collect information indirectly, mostly in developed countries by large businesses.
    
- **Projective Techniques:** These indirect interviewing techniques were developed by psychologists to infer underlying motives, urges, or intentions that respondents may be unable or unwilling to reveal.
    
    - **Word Association Tests:** A respondent is asked to say the first word that comes to mind after hearing a word from a list. This is frequently used in advertising research.
        
    - **Sentence Completion Tests:** An extension of word association, where an informant completes a sentence to reveal their attitudes. This technique helps in developing hypotheses and questionnaires.
        
    - **Story Completion Tests:** A researcher provides part of a story and asks the informant to complete it.
        
    - **Verbal Projection Tests:** A respondent is asked to explain what other people do, which may reveal their own motivations.
        
- **Depth Interviews:** These interviews are designed to uncover underlying motives and desires and are often used in motivational research. They require great skill and considerable time on the part of the interviewer.
    
- **Content Analysis:** This involves analyzing the contents of documentary materials like books, magazines, and newspapers, as well as other spoken or printed verbal materials. Prior to the 1940s, this was mostly quantitative, but since the 1950s, it has become more qualitative, focusing on the general message of the documents.
    

## Collection of Secondary Data

Secondary data is data that is already available because it has been collected and analyzed by someone else. When a researcher uses secondary data, they must look into various sources to obtain it. This data can be published or unpublished.

Published data can be found in:

- Publications of central, state, and local governments.
    
- Publications of foreign governments or international bodies.
    
- Technical and trade journals.
    
- Books, magazines, and newspapers.
    
- Reports from associations related to business and industry, banks, etc.
    
- Reports prepared by research scholars, universities, and economists.
    
- Public records, statistics, and historical documents.
    

Unpublished data sources include diaries, letters, unpublished biographies, and may be available from scholars, research workers, trade associations, and other organizations.

Researchers must be very careful when using secondary data, as it might be unsuitable or inadequate for their specific study. It is never safe to take published statistics at face value without understanding their meaning and limitations. Before using secondary data, a researcher must ensure it has the following characteristics:

- **Reliability of Data:** This can be tested by finding out who collected the data, the sources, if proper methods were used, when it was collected, if there was any compiler bias, and the level of accuracy desired and achieved.
    
- **Suitability of Data:** Data that is suitable for one inquiry may not be for another. The researcher must carefully scrutinize the definitions of terms and units of collection used in the original source. The object, scope, and nature of the original inquiry must also be studied.
    
- **Adequacy of Data:** If the level of accuracy is inadequate for the present inquiry, the data should not be used. Data is also considered inadequate if it relates to an area that is narrower or wider than the area of the current study.


It is risky to use already available data, but it should not be discarded if it is reliable, suitable, adequate, and from an authentic source, as using it can save time and energy.
