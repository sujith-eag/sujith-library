## Interview Method

This method involves the presentation of oral-verbal stimuli and relies on oral-verbal responses. It can be conducted through personal interviews or telephone interviews.

Personal Interviews:

An interviewer asks questions in a face-to-face contact. This can be a direct personal investigation, where the interviewer collects information personally from the sources, or an indirect oral investigation, where the interviewer cross-examines other people who have knowledge about the problem. Direct investigation is suitable for intensive studies, while indirect investigation is often used by government-appointed commissions and committees.

- **Structured Interviews:** Use a set of predetermined questions and highly standardized recording techniques. The interviewer follows a rigid procedure. This method is economical and provides a safe basis for generalization.
    
- **Unstructured Interviews:** Characterized by flexibility. The interviewer can ask supplementary questions, omit some, or change the sequence. This flexibility makes comparing interviews difficult and analysis more time-consuming. It is a central technique in exploratory or formulative research studies.
    
- **Other Types of Interviews:**
    
    - **Focussed interview:** Focuses on a given experience of the respondent and its effects.
        
    - **Clinical interview:** Concerned with broad underlying feelings or motivations or the course of an individual's life experience.
        
    - **Non-directive interview:** The interviewer encourages the respondent to talk about a topic with minimal direct questioning, acting as a catalyst.
        

**Merits of the Interview Method:**

- More information can be obtained in greater depth.
    
- The interviewer can overcome resistance from respondents.
    
- Greater flexibility, especially in unstructured interviews.
    
- Observation can be used to record verbal answers.
    
- Personal information can be obtained easily.
    
- Samples can be controlled effectively with low non-response rates.
    
- The interviewer controls who answers the questions.
    

**Demerits of the Interview Method:**

- It is an expensive method, especially with a large and geographically spread sample.
    
- There is a possibility of bias from both the interviewer and the respondent.
    
- Certain types of respondents, like important officials, may not be easily approachable.
    
- It is more time-consuming.
    
- The interviewer's presence might over-stimulate the respondent.
    
- The organization required for field staff is complex.
    
- It can introduce systematic errors.
    
- Requires proper rapport with respondents, which can be difficult to achieve.
    

Pre-requisites for Interviewing:

Interviewers should be carefully selected, trained, and briefed. They must be honest, sincere, hardworking, impartial, and have technical competence and practical experience. Field checks are necessary to ensure they are not deviating from instructions.

Telephone Interviews:

This method involves contacting respondents by telephone. It is widely used in industrial surveys in developed regions.

**Merits of Telephone Interviews:**

- More flexible than mailing methods.
    
- Faster way of obtaining information.
    
- Cheaper than personal interviews.
    
- Callbacks are simple and economical.
    
- Higher response rate than mailing methods.
    
- Replies can be recorded without embarrassing respondents.
    
- The interviewer can explain requirements easily.
    
- Access can be gained to respondents who are otherwise hard to contact.
    
- No field staff is required.
    
- A wider distribution of the sample is possible.
    

**Demerits of Telephone Interviews:**

- Respondents have little time for considered answers (usually under five minutes).
    
- Surveys are restricted to respondents with telephones.
    
- Cost considerations can restrict geographical coverage.
    
- Not suitable for intensive surveys requiring comprehensive answers.
    
- The possibility of interviewer bias is relatively more.
    
- Questions must be short and to the point.
    

#### Collection of Data Through Questionnaires

This popular method involves sending a questionnaire (a list of questions printed in a definite order) to people with a request to answer and return it. Respondents are expected to read, understand, and write down their replies in the provided space on their own.

**Merits of Questionnaires:**

- Low cost, even for a large and widely spread universe.
    
- Free from interviewer bias; answers are in the respondent's own words.
    
- Respondents have adequate time to give well-thought-out answers.
    
- Respondents who are not easily approachable can be reached conveniently.
    
- Large samples can be used, making results more dependable and reliable.
    

**Demerits of Questionnaires:**

- Low rate of return; bias due to non-response is often indeterminate.
    
- Can only be used with educated and cooperating respondents.
    
- Control over the questionnaire is lost once it is sent.
    
- Inflexible, as the approach cannot be amended after dispatch.
    
- Possibility of ambiguous or omitted replies.
    
- Difficult to know if willing respondents are truly representative.
    
- Likely to be the slowest method.
    

Main Aspects of a Questionnaire:

A questionnaire should be very carefully constructed.

- **General Form:** Can be structured (definite, concrete, pre-determined questions in the same order) or unstructured. The form of questions can be closed (yes/no) or open (free response).
    
- **Question Sequence:** A proper sequence reduces the chance of misunderstanding. It should be clear and smooth-moving, with easier questions at the beginning to arouse interest and cooperation. Avoid opening with questions that strain memory, are of a personal character, or relate to personal wealth.
    
- **Question Formulation and Wording:** Each question must be very clear and impartial. Questions should be constructed as part of a well-thought-out tabulation plan. They should be simple, concrete, and conform to the respondent's way of thinking.
    

**Essentials of a Good Questionnaire:**

- Should be comparatively short and simple.
    
- Questions should proceed in a logical sequence from easy to more difficult.
    
- Personal and intimate questions should be left to the end.
    
- Avoid technical terms and vague expressions.
    
- Questions can be dichotomous, multiple-choice, or open-ended (the latter should be used sparingly as they are hard to analyze).
    
- Should include some control questions to check the reliability of the respondent.
