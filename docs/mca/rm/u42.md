## Types of Report

1. **Technical Report:** Used when a full written report is required for record-keeping or public dissemination.
    
2. **Popular Report:** Used when research results have policy implications.
    

### Technical Report

The main emphasis is on the methods employed, assumptions made, and a detailed presentation of findings with their limitations and supporting data.

A general outline includes:

- **Summary of results:** A brief review of main findings.
    
- **Nature of the study:** Objectives, problem formulation, hypothesis, and analysis type.
    
- **Methods employed:** Specific methods used and their limitations (e.g., sample design).
    
- **Data:** Discussion of collected data, sources, characteristics, and limitations.
    
- **Analysis of data and presentation of findings:** Narration of data analysis and findings with supporting tables and charts.
    
- **Conclusions:** Detailed summary of findings and policy implications.
    
- **Bibliography.**
    
- **Technical appendices.**
    
- **Index.**
    

#### Popular Report

This report emphasizes simplicity and attractiveness, using clear writing, minimal technical details, and liberal use of charts and diagrams. It features an attractive layout with large print and many subheadings.

The general outline includes:

- **The findings and their implications:** Emphasis on findings of practical interest.
    
- **Recommendations for action:** Based on the study's findings.
    
- **Objective of the study:** How the problem arose and the project's specific objectives.
    
- **Methods employed:** A brief, non-technical description of methods and data.
    
- **Results:** The main body of the report, presenting results in clear terms with illustrations.
    
- **Technical appendices:** Contains more detailed information on methods and forms, but may be omitted if the report is for the general public.
    

### Oral Presentation

- Should be carefully prepared, keeping the audience in mind. A good presentation is not always a lengthy one.
    
- Carefully selected visual aids like graphs, tables, and charts can help. However, using too many visuals can be boring.
    
- Clear clarification is vital. The speaker should be patient, establish eye contact, and use effective body language and gestures.
    

### Mechanics of Writing a Research Report

- **Size of physical design:** Use unruled 8.5" x 11" paper, blue or black ink, have margins, and be double-spaced.
    
- **Layout:** Should be well-thought-out and appropriate for the objective and nature of the problem.
    
- **Treatment of quotations:** Use quotation marks. Short quotes are double-spaced; quotes longer than 4-5 lines are single-spaced.
    
- **Footnotes:** Used for cross-references, citations, acknowledgements, and explanations. They are placed at the bottom of the page, numbered consecutively, and single-spaced.
    
- **Documentation style:**
    
    - **Single-volume reference:** Author's name, title (underlined), place and date of publication, pagination.
        
    - **Multi-volume reference:** Include the volume number after the publication details.
        
    - **Alphabetically arranged works:** No pagination is needed (e.g., encyclopedias).
        
    - **Periodicals reference:** Author's name, article title (in quotes), periodical name (underlined), volume number, date, pagination.
        
    - **Multiple authorship:** Use "et al." or "and others."
        
- **Punctuation:** Author's name is followed by a comma. Capitalize the first word, proper nouns, and adjectives. The title is followed by a comma. Place of publication can be abbreviated. Copyright dates may be enclosed in square brackets.
    
- **Use of statistics, charts, and graphs:** Use tables, charts, bars, line graphs, and pictograms. They should be neat and attractive.
    
- **Final drafts:** Involves revising and rewriting the rough draft. Check for clarity, correct grammar, and logical flow.
    
- **Bibliography:** Prepared and appended to the report.
    
- **Preparation of the index:** Acts as a guide for the report. Can be a subject index or author index and is arranged alphabetically.
    

### Precautions for Writing Research Reports

- The report should be long enough to cover the subject but short enough to maintain interest.
    
- It should not be dull and should sustain the reader's interest.
    
- Avoid abstract terminology and technical jargon; write in an objective style and simple language.
    
- Make main findings readily available.
    
- The layout must be well-thought-out and appropriate.
    
- The report must be free from grammatical mistakes and follow proper composition techniques (quotations, footnotes, punctuation, etc.).
    
- It must present a logical analysis of the subject matter.
    
- A report should show originality and attempt to solve an intellectual problem.
    
- It should state policy implications and may forecast the subject's future, indicating areas for further research.
    
- Appendices for all technical data are necessary.
    
- A bibliography and index are essential.
    
- The report must be attractive, neat, and clean.
    
- Mention calculated confidence limits and any constraints experienced during the study.
    
- The introduction must clearly state the study's objective, the nature of the problem, the methods employed, and the analysis techniques.
