# Unit-4 Questions

## The Collections Framework

> Collections Overview, Collection Interfaces, The List Interface, The ArrayList Class, The LinkedList Class

**Part A: Framework Fundamentals**

1. What is the **Java Collections Framework**? Discuss its advantages and key interfaces.
    
Part B: The ArrayList

2. Develop a program to demonstrate common ArrayList operations (e.g., adding, removing, and accessing elements). Explain the scenarios where an ArrayList is the preferred choice.

3. Illustrate with an example of how to obtain a standard array from an ArrayList.

Part C: The LinkedList

4. Develop a program that demonstrates LinkedList operations, including adding and removing elements from both the first and last positions. Explain the scenarios where LinkedList is preferred over ArrayList.

5. Using the LinkedList class, write a Java program to implement a Queue (First-In, First-Out).
    
## Networking

> Networking Basics, Client-Server Communication using TCP and UDP

**Part A: High-Level Networking Concepts**

1. What is a **URL**? Explain each of its components.
	
2. Discuss any four network classes in Java. 
    
3. Explain the purpose of the Java `URL` and `InetAddress` classes.
    
**Part B: TCP/IP Socket Programming (Connection-Oriented)**

4. What are **TCP/IP Sockets**? Briefly explain the information they hold.
    
5. Explain the steps involved in establishing a TCP connection between a client and a server.
    
6. Write and explain a complete Java program for client-server communication using `Socket` and `ServerSocket`.
    
7. Write a client program to connect to the ‘whois’ service (port 43) to demonstrate a real-world socket connection.
    

**Part C: UDP Datagram Programming (Connectionless)**

8. Explain the roles of `DatagramSocket` and `DatagramPacket` in UDP communication.
     

## Lambda Expressions

> Introducing Lambda Expressions, Block Lambda Expressions

1. What is a Lambda Expression in Java? Provide an example.
    
2. Write a program that uses a lambda expression to implement a simple event handler. Explain how lambda expressions simplify the code.
    
3. Write a program to compute the factorial of an integer value using a block lambda expression.
