# Unit-2 Questions


## III. Packages and Interfaces

**B. Access Protection, Importing Packages**

1. **What is a package in Java?** Explain their purpose (e.g., namespace management, access control) and how they are defined.
    
2. **What are access specifiers?** List the four types (`public`, `private`, `protected`, and default) and explain what level of visibility each one provides.

3. Create a package named `shape`. Inside this package, create classes representing common shapes like `Square`, `Triangle`, and `Circle`. Write another program that imports and uses these classes from the `shape` package.
    
4. **Demonstrate Packages and Access Control with a Program:**
    Create a `Balance` class (e.g., for a bank account) and organize it into a package. Demonstrate access protection and importing this package in another class. Write a program to show how classes from different packages can interact using this `Balance` class.
       
5. Create a package named `geometry`. Inside this package, create a public class Circle with a method to calculate its area. Write a separate program in a different package that imports the `Circle` class and uses it.

**C. Interfaces**
1.  What is an interface in Java? Discuss its significance or use.

2.  Briefly explain how to define an interface and how a class can implement an interface.

3.  How does Java support the implementation of multiple interfaces by a single class? Provide an example.

4.  Differentiate between classes and interfaces, highlighting their key differences, including syntax.

5.  Differentiate between `extends` (for class inheritance) and `implements` (for interface implementation) with respect to inheritance concepts. Illustrate with a suitable example.

6.  What are default interface methods?

**D. Programming with Interfaces**
1.  Write a Java program to implement basic stack operations (e.g., push, pop, peek) using an interface.

2.  Write a Java program to implement basic queue operations (e.g., enqueue, dequeue, peek) using an interface.

3.  Create an interface named `Searchable` with a method `search(int[] arr, int key)` that searches for an element in an array of integers. Create two classes, `LinearSearch` and `BinarySearch`, that implement the `Searchable` interface and provide their own implementations of the `search()` method.

4.  Demonstrate the usage of an interface by:
	*   Creating an interface named `Shape`.
	*   Declaring appropriate abstract methods in `Shape` (e.g., `calculateArea()`). You might also consider data members if appropriate for the interface's design (though interfaces primarily define behavior).
	*   Implementing this `Shape` interface in three classes: `Circle`, `Triangle`, and `Square`, each providing a concrete implementation to compute its area.


## IV. Exception Handling

Part A: Fundamentals of Exception Handling

1. **What is an exception?** What is the purpose of exception handling?
	
2.  Write and explain the general form of an exception-handling block (using `try`, `catch`, `finally`).
	
3. **Explain the five keywords** used in Java exception handling (`try`, `catch`, `finally`, `throw`, `throws`). Illustrate their roles with a single, comprehensive code example.
    
4. **Explain how to handle multiple exception types** using multiple `catch` blocks. Also, demonstrate the functionality of a **nested `try` block**.
    
Part B: Exception Types and Custom Exceptions

5. What is the difference between checked and unchecked (runtime) exceptions? Provide examples of common built-in exceptions like `ArithmeticException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, `NullPointerException`, `FileNotFoundException` and `IOException`.

6. Explain how and why you would create a custom (user-defined) exception class in Java. Illustrate with an example.

Part C: Practical Application

6. Write a banking application program that demonstrates comprehensive exception handling. Create a custom InsufficientFundsException.
	The program should handle deposits and withdrawals. A withdrawal attempt for an amount greater than the balance should throw the InsufficientFundsException.
	Use a try-catch block to handle the custom exception gracefully.
	Use a finally block to display the account's final balance after any transaction attempt.

7.  Write a program that takes one integer number as input from the user. The program should throw a custom exception if the input number is greater than 20 (or 10, as per different versions of the question).

8.  Create custom exceptions named `InvalidAgeException` and `ArrayOutOfBoundException`. Write a Java program that takes command-line arguments. Based on the arguments (e.g., an age value, an array index), the program should handle the appropriate custom exception gracefully.
