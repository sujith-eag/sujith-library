# Program 7 : Multi-threading

Create a Java program to illustrates multi-threaded programming with synchronized blocks, creating and running multiple threads using `isAlive()`, and `join()`:

---

Multi-threading using a `synchronized` block to prevent race conditions. It creates three threads that share a single object. The `isAlive()` and `join()` methods are used to monitor and manage the threads from the main thread.

## 1. The Shared Resource (`CallMe.java`)

This class has a method that will be shared by multiple threads. The `synchronized(this)` block ensures that only one thread can execute the code within it at a time, preventing the output messages from getting jumbled.

```java
// CallMe.java
// This is the shared resource that threads will access.
class CallMe {

    public void call(String msg) {
        // A synchronized block locks the 'this' object
        synchronized(this) {
            try { // Simulate processing time
	            Thread.sleep(1000);
				System.out.print("[" + msg);
                Thread.sleep(1000);
				System.out.println("]");
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                System.out.println("Thread Interrupted");
            } finally {
	            System.out.println( Thread.currentThread().getName()
		            + " has Ended" )
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## 2. The Thread Task (`Caller.java`)

This class implements `Runnable`. Each instance represents a task that will call the shared `call()` method.

```java
// Caller.java

// This class defines the task that each thread will execute.
class Caller implements Runnable {
    private String msg;
    private CallMe target;

    public Caller(CallMe target, String msg) {
        this.target = target;
        this.msg = msg;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        target.call(msg);
    }
}
```

## 3. The Main Program (`MultiThreadSyncDemo.java`)

This class creates the shared object and multiple threads. It demonstrates the use of `isAlive()` to check thread status and `join()` to wait for threads to complete.

```java
// MultiThreadSyncDemo.java

// main class to orchestrate the multi-threaded execution.
public class MultiThreadSyncDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // single, shared instance of the CallMe resource.
        CallMe callMeTarget = new CallMe();
		
		// Creating tasks
		Caller task1 = new Caller(callMeTarget, "Hello");
		Caller task2 = new Caller(callMeTarget, "Synchronized");
		Caller task3 = new Caller(callMeTarget, "World");
		
		// Creating the threads (workers) and assigning tasks
		Thread t1 = new Thread(task1);
		Thread t2 = new Thread(task2);
		Thread t3 = new Thread(task3);
		
        // Starting the threads.
        System.out.println("Starting threads...");
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
        t3.start();

        // isAlive() to check if threads are still running.
        System.out.println("Checking thread status right after starting:");
        System.out.println(t1.getName() 
	        + " is alive: " + t1.isAlive());
        System.out.println(t2.getName() 
	        + " is alive: " + t2.isAlive());
        System.out.println(t3.getName() 
	        + " is alive: " + t3.isAlive());

        // join() to make the main thread wait for all other threads to finish.
        System.out.println("\nMain thread is waiting for child threads to complete...");
        try {
            t1.join();
            t2.join();
            t3.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println("Main thread Interrupted");
        }
        
        System.out.println("\nChild threads have completed.");

        // Checking the status again after join() returns.
        System.out.println("Checking thread status after join():");
        System.out.println(t1.getName() 
	        + " is alive: " + t1.isAlive()); // Will be false
        System.out.println(t2.getName() 
	        + " is alive: " + t2.isAlive()); // Will be false
        System.out.println(t3.getName() 
	        + " is alive: " + t3.isAlive()); // Will be false

        System.out.println("\n Main thread exiting.");
    }
}
```

## Expected Output

The output shows that because of the `synchronized` block, each call completes before the next one starts. The `isAlive()` checks show the threads state before and after they've finished, and `join()` ensures the main thread finishes last.

```
Starting threads...
Checking thread status right after starting:
Thread-0 is alive: true
Thread-1 is alive: true
Thread-2 is alive: true

Main thread is waiting for child threads to complete...
[Hello]
[Synchronized]
[World]

Child threads have completed.
Checking thread status after join():
Thread-0 is alive: false
Thread-1 is alive: false
Thread-2 is alive: false

Main thread exiting.
```
