# Unit-3 Questions

## Multithreaded Programming

> The Java Thread Model, The Main Thread, Creating a Thread, Creating Multiple Threads, Using isAlive() and join(), Thread Priorities, Synchronization, Inter-thread Communication, Suspending, Resuming, and Stopping Threads, Obtaining a Thread's State, Using Multithreading.


**Part A: Core Concepts**

1. What is a **thread**? Explain the difference between a **process** and a **thread**, and compare **multiprocessing** with **multithreading**.
    
2. Explain the Java **Thread Model** and the **life cycle of a thread** (New, Runnable, Running, Blocked, Terminated).
    

Part B: Creating and Managing Threads

3. What are the two primary ways to create a thread in Java? Provide a simple program that creates and runs multiple threads.

4. Explain the purpose of the isAlive() and join() methods for managing thread execution. Provide a code example.

5. What are thread priorities and how are they set? what is default priority?

Part C: Synchronization

6. What is thread synchronization and why is it necessary? Explain how it is achieved in Java using synchronized methods and synchronized blocks. Provide a code example.

Part D: Inter-thread Communication

7. Explain how threads can communicate using the wait(), notify(), and notifyAll() methods.

8. Write a program to implement the producer-consumer problem, demonstrating effective inter-thread communication.

Part E: Practical Application

9. Write a Java program using two threads to print numbers from 1 to 10 in sequence (i.e., Thread 1 prints "1", Thread 2 prints "2", Thread 1 prints "3", and so on).

## Enumerations and Autoboxing

> Enumerations, Type Wrappers, Autoboxing.


**Part A: Enumerations**

1. What is an **enumeration (`enum`)** in Java? Demonstrate its basic use with suitable constant values and explain the `values()` and `valueOf()` methods with a code example.
    
2. Write a program to create a `DayOfWeek` enumeration and add a custom method `isWorkDay()` to it, demonstrating that an `enum` can function like a class. For workday it should return true and the call `DayOfWeek.SUNDAY.isWorkDay()` should return `false`. 
    
Part B: Type Wrappers and Autoboxing

3. What are Type Wrappers? Explain why they are necessary in Java (e.g., for use in collections) with an example.

4. What are Autoboxing and Unboxing? Provide a code example that shows how this feature simplifies using primitive types with wrapper classes.
  
## Generics

> What are Generics?, A Simple Generics Example, A Generics Class with two Type Parameters, The General Form of a Generic Class.

1. What are Generics in Java? Explain their purpose (e.g., type safety, eliminating casts) and provide the general form of a generic class. 

2. Write a program demonstrating a generic class that can work with different data types, such as `Integer` and `String`.
    
3. How do you create a generic class with multiple type parameters? Provide a code example of a generic `Pair` class that can hold two different types of objects (e.g., a `String` and an `Integer`).
