# Layered Architecture

In computer science, a **layered architecture** is a design pattern that breaks down a complex system into a series of distinct, manageable **layers**. 
Each layer has a specific responsibility and **provides services** to the layer directly above it while **using services** from the layer below.

This model is fundamental to computer networking and is also widely used in software engineering. 


## Purpose of Layered Architecture

- **Modularity**: It divides a complex problem into smaller, more manageable parts. This allows different teams to work on different layers simultaneously.
    
- **Abstraction**: Each layer hides the complex details of its implementation from the other layers. A layer only needs to know how to interact with the layers immediately above and below it.
    
- **Standardization**: It promotes the creation of standard interfaces between layers. This ensures that a layer from one vendor can work with a layer from another vendor, fostering interoperability.
    
- **Flexibility and Maintainability**: A single layer can be modified or updated without affecting the entire system, as long as its interface with adjacent layers remains unchanged.
    
- **Simplified Troubleshooting**: When a problem occurs, it can be isolated to a specific layer, making debugging much easier.
    

## OSI Reference Model

The **Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model** is a conceptual framework created by the **International Organization for Standardization (ISO)**. It standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven distinct layers.

While the OSI model is a foundational tool for understanding network communication, most modern networks, including the Internet, are built on the more practical **TCP/IP model**. However, the OSI model remains an invaluable educational and diagnostic tool for its clear separation of functions.

### The 7 Layers of the OSI Model

A common mnemonic to remember the layers from top to bottom is: "**A**ll **P**eople **S**eem **T**o **N**eed **D**ata **P**rocessing."

- **Layer 7**: Application Layer
    
- **Layer 6**: Presentation Layer
    
- **Layer 5**: Session Layer
    
- **Layer 4**: Transport Layer
    
- **Layer 3**: Network Layer
    
- **Layer 2**: Data Link Layer
    
- **Layer 1**: Physical Layer
    

## OSI Model Layer Details


### Layer 7: Application Layer

Provides network services directly to end-user applications.

- Serves as the interface between the user's application and the network. Translates user requests and application data into network operations.
	
- Handles tasks like user authentication, identifying communication partners, and determining resource availability.

**Examples**: Web browsers (HTTP/HTTPS), email clients (SMTP, POP3), and file transfer programs (FTP).

### Layer 6: Presentation Layer

Acts as the "translator" for the network, ensuring that data sent from the application layer of one system can be understood by the application layer of another system.
    
- **Data Translation**: Translates data between the format the application uses and a common network format (e.g., converting character encoding from ASCII to EBCDIC).
	
- **Encryption and Decryption**: Manages the encryption of data for security and its decryption upon receipt.
	
- **Compression**: Compresses data to reduce the amount of bandwidth required for transmission.
        
**Examples**: SSL/TLS encryption, data compression (e.g., GZIP), and data formatting for file types like JPEG and GIF.
    
---

### Layer 5: Session Layer

Establishes, manages, and terminates communication sessions between applications oh different hosts.
    
- **Dialogue Control**: Determines which device can transmit at any given time (half-duplex or full-duplex).
	
- **Synchronization**: Inserts checkpoints into the data stream, allowing a session to resume from the last checkpoint in case of a failure.
	
**Examples**: APIs that manage remote procedure calls (RPCs), NetBIOS.

### Layer 4: Transport Layer

Provides end-to-end data delivery and error recovery between processes on different hosts.
        
- **Process-to-Process Communication**: Uses port numbers to direct data to the correct application on a host.
	
- **Segmentation and Reassembly**: Breaks large data chunks from the upper layers into smaller segments for transmission and reassembles them at the destination.
	
- **Connection Control**: Can be either connection-oriented (**TCP**), which provides reliable, ordered delivery, or connectionless (**UDP**), which offers a faster but less reliable service.
	
- **Flow Control and Error Control**: Manages the rate of data transmission to prevent overwhelming the receiver and ensures data integrity (primarily with TCP).

**Data Unit**: Segment (TCP) or Datagram (UDP)

**Examples**: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

### Layer 3: Network Layer

Manages logical addressing and routing of data across multiple networks to determine the best path from source to destination.    
    
- **Logical Addressing**: Assigns and uses logical addresses, such as **IP addresses**, to identify devices on the network.
	
- **Routing**: Determines the best path for data to travel from the source to the destination across an internetwork.
	
- **Packet Forwarding**: Moves packets from an incoming link to the appropriate outgoing link on a router.

* Provides services like fragmentation of packets if they are too large for an underlying network and reassembly at the destination.

**Data Unit**: Packet

**Examples**: IP (Internet Protocol), ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol), and routing protocols like OSPF and BGP.
    
---

### Layer 2: Data Link Layer

Manages the transfer of data between two directly connected nodes on the same physical link. (Node to Node delivery)
        
- **Physical Addressing**: Uses **MAC addresses** to identify devices on a local network segment.
	
- **Framing**: Packages bits from the physical layer into frames and adds a header and trailer.
	
- **Error Detection**: Adds a checksum to the frame to detect if the data was corrupted during transmission.
	
- **Flow Control**: Manages the rate of data transmission on a specific link.
        
- **Sublayers**: Often divided into two sublayers: the **Logical Link Control (LLC)** and the **Media Access Control (MAC)**.
    
**Data Unit**: Frame

**Examples**: Ethernet, Wi-Fi (802.11), PPP.

### Layer 1: Physical Layer

Manages the transmission and reception of raw, unstructured bits over a physical medium.
	
- Defines the physical characteristics of the network, such as the type of cables, connectors, and signaling methods used.
	
- Converts digital bits into electrical, radio, or optical signals for transmission.
	
- Manages bit synchronization to ensure the sender and receiver are aligned.
- Modulation, physical data rate

**Data Unit**: Bit

**Examples**: Ethernet cables (copper), fiber optic cables, radio waves (Wi-Fi), and hardware like network interface cards (NICs), hubs, and repeaters.
