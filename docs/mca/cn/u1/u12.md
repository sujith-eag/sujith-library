# Internet Protocol (IP) and IP Addresses

## Internet Protocol (IP)

The **Internet Protocol (IP)** is a set of rules for routing and addressing packets of data so they can travel across networks and arrive at the correct destination. 

IP defines the **rules and structure** for how data should be **packaged, addressed, transmitted, and routed** between devices.
   
It is the principal communications protocol in the Internet protocol suite for relaying datagrams across network boundaries. It operates at the **network layer (Layer 3)** of the OSI model.

## IP Address

An **IP address** is a **logical, numerical label** assigned to each device on a network. It serves two primary functions:

1. **Network Identification (NID)**: It identifies the network the device is on.
    
2. **Host Identification (HID)**: It identifies the specific device on that network.
    
IP addresses are essential for proper communication between devices on both local and wide area networks (LANs and WANs).

## IP Address Versions

- **IPv1–IPv3**: Early, experimental versions that were never widely deployed.
    
- **IPv4**: The first major version, using a **32-bit address** scheme. It is still widely used but has largely run out of available addresses.
    
- **IPv5**: An experimental protocol for streaming video and voice, which was never publicly adopted.
    
- **IPv6**: The current standard, using a **128-bit address** scheme to provide a virtually limitless number of unique addresses.
    
- **IPv7–IPv15**: These versions are either reserved for future use or were experimental.
    

## IPv4 Address Classes

IPv4 addresses are divided into classes, which historically determined the size of the network by allocating a certain number of bits for the network portion and the host portion of the address.

- An IPv4 address is a **32-bit** number, often shown as four decimal numbers (octets) separated by dots (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
	
- Binary notation (e.g., `11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001`)
    
- This provides a total of **2³²** (about 4.3 billion) unique addresses.
    
IPv4 addresses are categorized into five different **classes** based on their **starting bits** and **address ranges**. This classification helps in defining the **size of networks** and how many **hosts (devices)** they can support.

> Class A : 0                 = 0
> Class B : 0+128       = 128
> Class C : 128+64    = 192
> Class D : 192+32    = 224
> Class E : 224+16     = 240
>         240+16   = 256


___

### Class A

- **Leading Bits**: 0
    
- **Range**: `1.0.0.0` to `126.255.255.255`
    
- **Default Subnet Mask**: `255.0.0.0`
    
- **Total Networks**: 126 (The `0.x.x.x` range is reserved, and the `127.x.x.x` range is for loopback and diagnostic purposes).
    
- **Hosts per Network**: 16 million, 16,777,214 (`2²⁴ − 2`). The two subtracted addresses are the network address (all host bits are 0) and the broadcast address (all host bits are 1).
    
- **Use Case**: Designed for very large, enterprise-level networks, such as those used by multinational corporations and governments.

### Class B

- **Leading Bits**: 10
    
- **Range**: `128.0.0.0` to `191.255.255.255`
    
- **Default Subnet Mask**: `255.255.0.0`
    
- **Total Networks**: 16,384 (`2¹⁴`)
    
- **Hosts per Network**: 65,534 (`2¹⁶ − 2`)
    
- **Use Case**: Suited for medium to large-sized networks, like those for universities and large companies.

### Class C

- **Leading Bits**: 110
    
- **Range**: `192.0.0.0` to `223.255.255.255`
    
- **Default Subnet Mask**: `255.255.255.0`
    
- **Total Networks**: 2,097,152 (`2²¹`)
    
- **Hosts per Network**: 254 (`2⁸ − 2`)
    
- **Use Case**: Intended for small networks, commonly used by small businesses and for home networks.
    
---

### Class D

- **Leading Bits**: 1110
    
- **Range**: `224.0.0.0` to `239.255.255.255`
    
- **Use Case**: Reserved for **multicasting**. This is used for applications that send data to multiple recipients simultaneously, such as video conferencing and online gaming. It doesn't have the traditional network/host structure.
    
---

### Class E

- **Leading Bits**: 1111
    
- **Range**: `240.0.0.0` to `254.255.255.255`
    
- **Use Case**: Reserved for **experimental and research purposes**. These addresses are not used on the public internet and are not allocated for general use.

	
## Private IP Addresses

A **private IP address** is an address used for devices within a local, private network (like a home or office). These addresses are not routable on the public internet and are used to conserve the limited number of public IPv4 addresses. To access the internet, a device with a private IP address must go through a router that uses **NAT (Network Address Translation)**, which allows multiple devices to share a single public IP address.

The IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) has reserved the following ranges for private networks:

| Class | Range                             |
| ----- | --------------------------------- |
| A     | `10.0.0.0` – `10.255.255.255`     |
| B     | `172.16.0.0` – `172.31.255.255`   |
| C     | `192.168.0.0` – `192.168.255.255` |
