# Weak Entity Types

- **Strong entity types** are those that have a **key attribute** of their own.
    
- **Weak entity types** are **entity types that do not have key attributes** of their own.
    
Entities of a weak entity type are identified by being related to **specific entities from another (owner) entity type**, combined with one or more of their own attribute values.

### Identifying Relationships

- The **owner** or **identifying entity type** provides the context needed to identify a weak entity.
    
- The **relationship** that connects a weak entity to its owner is called the **identifying relationship**.
    
- A weak entity type always has **total participation** in its identifying relationship, because it cannot exist without being related to an owner entity.
    
> Not every entity related to another is weak. For example, `DRIVER_LICENSE` has its own key (`License_number`), so even though it’s related to `PERSON`, it is a **strong entity**, not weak.

### DEPENDENT

The entity type `DEPENDENT` is related to `EMPLOYEE` to track dependents via a **1:N relationship**.

- Two dependents (from different employees) may share the same values for attributes like `Name`, `Birth_date`, `Sex`, and `Relationship`.
    
- However, they are considered distinct because they are connected to different `EMPLOYEE` entities.
    
- The **employee owns** the dependent entities related to them.

### Partial Key

- A **partial key** is an attribute (or set of attributes) that uniquely identifies a weak entity **within the context of its identifying relationship**.
    
- It is **not sufficient alone** to identify the entity, but **combined with the owner entity’s key**, it becomes unique.
    
---

### ER Diagram Notation

- A **weak entity type** is represented by a **double rectangle**.
    
- Its **identifying relationship** is shown as a **double diamond**.
    
- The **partial key attribute** is **underlined using a dashed or dotted line**.
    
---

- Weak entities can exist at **multiple levels**, i.e., a weak entity may have its own weak dependents.
    
- A weak entity can also be identified by **more than one owner**, meaning the identifying relationship can have **degree higher than two**.

## ER Diagrams, Naming Conventions, and Design Issues

### Proper Naming of Schema Constructs

Good naming helps improve schema clarity and usability. The following conventions are generally followed:

- **Entity type names** and **relationship type names**: written in **UPPERCASE** and in the **singular** form (e.g., `EMPLOYEE`, `MANAGES`).
    
- **Attribute names**: **capitalize the first letter** of each word (e.g., `StartDate`, `BirthDate`).
    
- **Role names**: written in **lowercase** (e.g., `manager`, `worker`).
    
> - **Nouns** in the real-world narrative often become **entity types**.
>     
> - **Verbs** often indicate **relationship types**.
>     
> - **Adjectives or descriptive nouns** usually correspond to **attributes**.

### Design Choices in ER Conceptual Modeling

Sometimes, it can be unclear whether a miniworld concept should be modeled as:

- An **entity type**
    
- An **attribute**
    
- A **relationship type**
    
#### Refining Attributes into Relationships

- If an attribute is actually a reference to another entity, it should be modeled as a **relationship**.
    
- If two such attributes are **inverse references**, they are better modeled as a **binary relationship**.
    
- Once converted into a relationship, the attribute should be **removed** from the entity to avoid **duplication**.
    
#### Promoting Attributes to Entity Types

- If the same attribute appears in **multiple entity types**, it may be **promoted to an independent entity type**.
    
> In a `UNIVERSITY` database, if `STUDENT`, `INSTRUCTOR`, and `COURSE` all have a `Department` attribute,  it may be better to create a separate `DEPARTMENT` entity with an attribute like `Dept_name`, and then relate it to the other entities with proper relationships.
