# Categories of NoSQL Systems

NoSQL databases emerged to address the **scalability, performance, and flexibility** limitations of traditional relational databases, especially when dealing with **big data**, **semi-structured/unstructured data**, and **real-time processing** needs.

NoSQL systems are classified based on **data models**, **storage structures**, and **query capabilities**.

The four **primary categories** are:

## 1. Document-Based NoSQL Systems

These systems store data as collections of similar, self-describing documents, often using formats like **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or BSON (Binary JSON)**. Schemaless, ideal for evolving data structures.
  
A major difference from object or XML systems is that there is **no requirement to specify a schema**; documents can have different data elements. Users can specify a partial schema to improve storage efficiency, but it's not mandatory.

Documents are accessible via a unique document ID (e.g., `_id` in MongoDB), and can also be rapidly accessed using other secondary indexes based on document content.

- Examples: **MongoDB**, **CouchDB**
    
## 2. Key-Value Stores

These systems utilize a simple data model based on **fast access to a value given its unique key**. The key is a unique identifier, and the value can be a string of bytes, a record, an object, or even a document

They prioritize high performance, availability, and horizontal scalability. Many key-value stores do not have a query language, providing instead a set of operations via a programming API

- **Use Case**: High-speed lookups, session storage, caching.
    
- Examples: DynamoDB, Apache Cassandra, Redis, Oracle NoSQL Database
    
## 3. Column-Based or Wide-Column Stores

These systems partition a table by column into **column families**, where each column family is stored in its own files. This is a form of vertical partitioning.

They typically use a multidimensional key consisting of components like table name, row key, column family, column qualifier, and timestamp. The data model includes storage-related concepts and allows for **versioning of data values** with timestamps.

- **Scalability**: Optimized for large-scale, write-heavy workloads.

- Examples: Apache HBase, Google Bigtable, Apache Cassandra
    
## 4. Graph-Based NoSQL Systems

Data is represented as a **graph, consisting of nodes (vertices) and directed edges (relationships)**. Both nodes and edges can have labels (or types) and properties (data items) associated with them.

Related nodes can be found by traversing edges using path expressions.

- **Use Case**: Ideal for highly connected data, such as **social networks**, **recommendation systems**, and **network analysis**.
    
- **Querying**: Uses path traversal or graph-specific languages like **Cypher**.
    
- Examples: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, GraphBase
    
## Other Categories of NoSQL Systems

In addition to the four main types, some systems span across multiple categories or support specialized models:

### 5. Hybrid NoSQL Systems

Combine features of two or more types (e.g., document + graph).
    
- **Example**: **OrientDB** supports document and graph models.
    
### 6. Object-Oriented Databases

- Store data as **objects**, closely aligning with object-oriented programming. Support object identities, inheritance, and encapsulation.
    
- **Examples**: **db4o**, **ObjectDB**, **Versant**
    
### 7. XML Databases

- Designed to store, query, and manage **XML documents**. Useful when XML is used as a standard data interchange format.
    
- **Examples**: **BaseX**, **eXist-db**

___

* Google developed a proprietary NOSQL system known as BigTable, Apache Hbase is an open source NOSQL system based on similar concepts.  led to the category of NOSQL systems known as column-based or wide column stores;

* Amazon developed a NOSQL system called DynamoDB that is available through Amazon’s cloud services. This innovation led to the category known as key-value data stores or sometimes key-tuple or key-object data stores. DynamoDB, Oracle key-value store. Redis key-value cache and store.

* Facebook developed a NOSQL system called Cassandra, which is now open source and known as Apache Cassandra. This NOSQL system uses concepts from both key-value stores and column-based systems.
