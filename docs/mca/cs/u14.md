# Defense and Responsible Online Behavior

## Proactive Defense Strategies for Organizations

Organizations must adopt proactive strategies to defend against cyber threats, focusing on comprehensive security frameworks and continuous monitoring.

### Information Security

**Information Security** is the practice of protecting information, equipment, devices, and computer resources from unauthorized access, use, disruption, modification, or destruction. This discipline covers both the physical security of devices and the digital security of the information they contain.

### Attack Surface Management (ASM)

**Attack Surface Management (ASM)** involves adopting a hacker's perspective to continuously identify, monitor, and minimize an organization's exposed digital assets. The goal is to reduce the number of potential entry points for an attacker.

Key activities in ASM include:

- **Continuous Discovery**: Performing ongoing inventory and monitoring of all potentially vulnerable assets.
    
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Watching for vulnerabilities across on-premises, cloud, and even "shadow IT" (unauthorized user-deployed) systems.
    
- **Identifying Hidden Risks**: Taking a hacker's approach helps uncover not only known assets but also forgotten ones ("orphaned IT") or malicious ones planted by threats ("rogue IT").
    

## Practical Preventive Measures

Effective defense relies on implementing practical security measures at both the personal and system levels.

### Personal Security Habits

Every user can take simple yet powerful steps to enhance their security posture:

- **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: This adds a crucial extra layer of security to your online accounts.
    
- **Use Strong, Unique Passwords**: Avoid easily guessable information to protect your accounts from being compromised.
    
- **Monitor Financial Statements Regularly**: Quickly detecting unauthorized transactions can significantly mitigate financial losses.
    
- **Be Cautious with Personal Information**: Avoid sharing sensitive details online or over the phone unless you are absolutely certain of the recipient's identity.
    
- **Educate Yourself and Others**: Awareness is one of the most effective tools for recognizing and avoiding cyber threats.
    

### System Security Best Practices

Securing the devices and networks you use is fundamental to preventing cyber attacks:

- **Install and Update Security Software**: Use reputable antivirus and anti-spyware software and ensure it is always kept up to date.
    
- **Enable Automatic OS Updates**: Keep your operating system patched against the latest known vulnerabilities.
    
- **Use a Firewall**: A firewall helps prevent unauthorized access to your system when you are connected to the internet.
    
- **Download from Trusted Sources Only**: Reduce the risk of malware by downloading software exclusively from official and reputable websites.
    
- **Take Immediate Action if Infected**: If you suspect your system is compromised, immediately scan it, disconnect from the internet, and reset your credentials.
    
## Responsible Netizenship

A **netizen** is an active internet user who regularly participates in online communities like social media, forums, and blogs, contributing to the digital world through content and building a significant online presence. Responsible netizenship is crucial for creating a safer online environment.
