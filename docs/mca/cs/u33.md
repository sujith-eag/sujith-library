# Botnet

A **bot** is a script or program designed to perform automated tasks. When infected with malicious code, a bot can join a botnet.

A **botnet** (short for _robot network_, also known as a **zombie network**) is a collection of compromised computers, devices, or systems, **bots** that are remotely controlled by a cybercriminal (referred to as a **botmaster**). These systems are typically infected with malware and controlled without the knowledge of their owners.

Once compromised, a device may appear to function normally while secretly receiving and executing instructions from a **Command and Control (C&C)** server.

### Common Attack Vectors:

- **Phishing emails** with malicious attachments or links
    
- **Drive-by downloads** from compromised websites
    
- **Malvertising** (malicious advertisements on legitimate sites)
    
- **Exploiting software vulnerabilities** in operating systems, web browsers, or mobile apps
    
- **Infected USB drives** or installation of cracked software

Once infected, the bot communicates with the Command and Control (C&C) server for instructions.

### Typical Attack Surface:

- Personal computers and smartphones
    
- **IoT devices** such as routers, smart TVs, webcams (often poorly secured)
    
- Servers with weak login credentials
    
- Cloud-based instances with exposed **SSH** or **RDP** ports
    

Modern botnets increasingly target **IoT devices** due to their persistent connectivity and weak default security.

### Common Uses of Botnets

Botnets can be used for both **financial gain** and **disruption**, including:

- **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** attacks
    
- **Spam distribution**
    
- **Malware propagation** (e.g., ransomware, spyware)
    
- **Click fraud** (generating false ad revenue)
    
- **Credential stuffing** (automated login attempts using leaked credentials)
    
- **Cryptojacking** (mining cryptocurrency using infected devices)
    
- **Data theft and surveillance**

# DoS and DDoS Attacks

A **Denial-of-Service (DoS)** or **Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)** attack is a malicious attempt to make a computer, website, or network resource unavailable to its intended users. The attacker's goal is to disrupt service by overwhelming the target with a flood of illegitimate traffic.

These attacks often target high-profile services like banks, e-commerce sites, and online gaming platforms.

## DoS Attack

A **Denial-of-Service (DoS)** attack originates from a **single source**. The attacker attempts to exhaust the resources of the target system, such as its bandwidth, memory, or processing power. To hide their identity, attackers often use **IP address spoofing**, where they forge the source IP address in the attack packets.

### Symptoms of a DoS Attack

- Unusually slow network performance.
    
- Inability to access a specific website or any website.
    
- A sudden and dramatic increase in spam emails (an "email bomb").
    
### Common DoS Techniques

DoS attacks can be broadly classified by the method they use to disrupt the target.

#### 1. Volumetric (Flood) Attacks

These attacks consume all the available bandwidth by sending a massive volume of traffic.

- **Ping Flood:** Overwhelms the target with a huge number of ICMP "ping" packets.
    
- **Smurf Attack:** The attacker sends pings to a network broadcast address while spoofing the victim's IP, causing every device on that network to reply to the victim, flooding it with traffic.
    
#### 2. Protocol Attacks

These attacks exploit weaknesses in network protocols like TCP.

- **SYN Flood:** The attacker sends a high volume of TCP "SYN" packets (the first step in a connection) but never completes the handshake. This leaves the server waiting for a response, filling up its connection queue and blocking legitimate users.
    
- **Ping of Death:** Sends an oversized or malformed packet that can crash the receiving system as it tries to process it.
    
- **Teardrop Attack:** Sends fragmented IP packets with overlapping, corrupted data that can crash the target system when it tries to reassemble them.
    
#### 3. Application-Layer Attacks

These attacks target specific applications or services, like a web server (HTTP) or DNS, with requests that are designed to consume server resources.

- **Unintentional DoS attacks:** This occurs when a sudden spike in popularity, often from a link on a major website, overwhelms a smaller site with traffic, having the same effect as a deliberate attack.
  
## DDoS Attack

A **Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)** attack is a large-scale, coordinated attack that originates from **many different sources** simultaneously.

To achieve this, the attacker first creates a **botnet**—a network of compromised computers, often called "zombies." These computers are infected with malware that allows the attacker to control them remotely. 

At the attacker's command, every bot in the network launches a synchronized attack against the same target (server, network, service), generating a tidal wave of overwhelming traffic that is nearly impossible for a single target to withstand. Rendering it inaccessible to legitimate users.

DDoS attacks use the same fundamental techniques as DoS attacks (volumetric, protocol, and application-layer), but at a vastly larger and more disruptive scale. Makes tracing and blocking difficult
   


## Defense and Detection

Protecting against DoS and DDoS attacks requires a multi-layered strategy focused on preparation, traffic filtering, and rapid detection.

### Proactive Defense Strategies

The Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT/CC) recommends several key measures:

- **Filtering and Rate Limiting:** Use firewalls and routers to filter malicious traffic as Intrusion detection and Prevention system and limit the number of requests a single source can make(rate limiting).
    
- **System Hardening:** Install all security patches (especially for TCP SYN flooding), disable unused network services, and implement quota systems on your operating system.
    
- **Redundancy:** Use load balancers and invest in "hot spares"—backup machines that can be quickly brought online if the primary system fails.
    
- **Traffic Monitoring:** Establish a baseline for your normal network performance so you can easily spot unusual activity that might indicate an attack.
    
- **Security Policies:** Maintain strong password policies, regularly audit your physical security, and use tools like Tripwire to detect unauthorized changes to configuration files.
	
- Use **DDoS protection services** (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS Shield)

| **Zombie Zapper** | Defense               | An open-source tool that can identify and send a "stop" command to known DDoS zombies, forcing them to cease an attack. |
| **RID**           | Defense               | A packet snooper that can detect the presence of common DDoS clients like Trinoo or TFN on a network.                   |
