### Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)

- IPR are legal rights that protect creations of the mind such as inventions, literary and artistic works, symbols, names, images, and designs used in commerce.
    
- **Importance:**
    
    - Encourages innovation and creativity.
        
    - Grants exclusive rights to creators/inventors.
        
    - Helps in economic development and commercialization.
        
- The logical basis for IP is very simple: one is the incentive theory (Creativity), and the other is the monopoly right (Granted to people who innovate for a limited period of time).
    
- When the limited period of protection is over, the society can use this particular knowledge for further innovation (Ex: Patent is granted for a period of 20 years).
    
- India has complied with the TRIPS agreement and enacted or amended its laws in accordance with the obligations under the TRIPS agreement.
