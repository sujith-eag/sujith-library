## 2020s Policy Shifts

The 2020s marked a period of significant regulatory overhaul, driven by the increasing focus on data localization, misinformation, and the need for a modern data protection bill.

### Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023

This landmark legislation was enacted to protect the digital personal data of individuals while allowing for its lawful processing.

- **Objective**: To establish the rights of individuals (Data Principals) regarding their data, including access, correction, and grievance redressal and the obligations of entities that process data (Data Fiduciaries).
    
- **Applicability**: The Act applies to both government and private entities processing digital personal data.
    
- **Key Provisions**: It provides individuals with rights to access and correct their data, allows cross-border data transfers to notified countries, and imposes severe penalties of up to **₹250 crore** for non-compliance.
    
#### Proposed Digital India Act

A new, comprehensive **Digital India Act** is currently being drafted with the intention of replacing the more than two-decades-old IT Act, 2000. Its focus is on:

- Regulating emerging technologies like AI, blockchain, and Web3.
    
- Addressing modern challenges such as online safety, deepfakes, and misinformation.
    
- Ensuring platform accountability and algorithmic transparency.
    
#### Other Regulatory Developments

- **Enhanced Role of MeitY and CERT-In**: New directives have been issued that mandate the reporting of data breaches and cyber incidents. Service providers are also required to maintain logs for 180 days to strengthen cybersecurity compliance.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of the IT Act, 2000


The IT Act, 2000, while foundational, has both significant strengths and notable weaknesses.

### Advantages

- It gave legal recognition to electronic communications like emails and messages, making them admissible as evidence in court.
    
- It provided the essential legal framework needed for companies to conduct e-commerce and e-business operations.
    
- The Act legalized digital signatures, which simplified online transactions and identity verification on the internet.
    
- It offered corporations statutory remedies in cases of unauthorized access or hacking of their computer systems and networks.
    
- It identified and penalized various cybercrimes, such as hacking, spamming, and phishing, that were not addressed in any previous legislation.
    
- The legislation allows individuals to receive monetary compensation as a remedy for damages to their computer systems.
    
- It permits companies to act as certifying authorities for issuing digital certificates.
    
- The Act empowers the Indian Government to issue official notices over the internet through e-governance.
    

### Disadvantages

- The Act fails to adequately address issues related to internet domain names, including the rights and liabilities of domain owners.
    
- It does not sufficiently protect Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) concerning computer programs and networks.
    
- Many types of cybercrimes, such as cyberstalking, cyber fraud, and chat room abuse, are not explicitly covered by the Act.
    
- The legislation has been criticized for failing to effectively address critical issues of online privacy and content regulation.


## Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) in India

Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) are the legal rights that protect creations of the mind, such as inventions, literary works, and designs used in commerce.

The importance of IPR lies in its ability to:

- Encourage **innovation and creativity**.
    
- Grant **exclusive rights** to creators and inventors.
    
- Help in **economic development** and commercialization.
    
#### Guiding Principles

The logical basis for IPR is twofold: the **incentive theory**, which promotes creativity, and the **monopoly right**, which is granted to innovators for a limited time. 

Once this protection period ends (e.g., 20 years for a patent), society can use the knowledge for further innovation. India has aligned its laws with the TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) agreement.
