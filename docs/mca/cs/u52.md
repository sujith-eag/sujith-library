## IT Act 2000: Objectives, Features, Amendments, Sections, Offences and Penalties

Over the past decade, the rise of technology and electronic commerce has led to a surge in cybercrimes and data-related offences in India. As per the latest news by a renowned paper house, the cybercrime cases increased from 3,693 in 2012 to 65,893 in 2022, recording the highest spike rate. The situation became alarming as even data crucial to national security and integrity was at risk. In response, the government opted to regulate activities on electronic mediums and the data stored therein.

### IT Act 2000 and Its Amendments

As technology evolved over time, the Indian Parliament recognized the need to revise the Act in order to align it with societal needs, resulting in its amendment. Two significant amendments were made to the IT Act 2000 that you should know about.

1. Amendment of 2008

The 2008 amendment came up with modifications to Section 66A of the IT Act, 2000. The section outlined penalties for sharing offensive messages electronically. This includes any message or information that incited hatred or compromised the integrity and security of the nation. However, the lack of clarity in defining 'offensive' messages led to unnecessary punishment of several individuals, ultimately resulting in the striking down of the section.

2. Amendment Bill 2015

In 2015, another bill was initiated to amend Section 66A with the aim of safeguarding the fundamental rights guaranteed to citizens by the country's Constitution. This was later accomplished by declaring it as violative of Article 19 of the Constitution.

### Digital Signature Under IT Act 2000

The Act further mandates all companies/LLPs under the MCA21 e-Governance programme to utilise digital signatures for document filing.

### Cyber Crime Under IT Act 2000

When it comes to cybersecurity, there are 5 main types of laws followed in India. These include the Information Technology Act 2000 (IT Act), the Indian Penal Code of 1860 (IPC), the Information Technology Rules (IT Rules), the Companies Act of 2013, and the Cybersecurity Framework (NCFS).

The cyber law established under the IT Act of 2000 stands as the first cyber law approved by the Indian Parliament. It highlights penalties and sanctions enacted by the Parliament of India that safeguard the sectors of e-governance, e-banking and e-commerce.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of IT Act 2000

While the IT Act of 2000 offers numerous benefits, it also carries certain disadvantages. Let us begin by exploring its advantages.

- Before the Act was enacted, emails, messages and such other means of communication were not legally recognised and thus not admissible as evidence in court. However, with the introduction of the IT Act of 2000, electronic communications gained legal recognition.
    
- By leveraging the legal infrastructure provided by this Act, companies can engage in e-commerce or e-business.
    
- With the legalisation of digital signatures, it has become easier to carry out transactions online or verify the identity of an individual on the internet.
    
- Corporations get statutory remedies in the event of unauthorised access or hacking into their computer systems or networks.
    
- Individuals get monetary assistance or compensation as a remedy for damages of any kind incurred in computer systems.
    
- The Act identifies and penalises various cybercrimes such as hacking, spamming, identity theft, phishing, and so on, which were previously not addressed in any legislation.
    
- The Act permits companies to serve as certifying authorities and issue digital certificates.
    
- It empowers the Indian Government to issue notices on the internet through e-governance.
    

Let us now walk through a list of disadvantages that came forth after the enactment of the Information Technology Act 2000:

- The Information Technology Act of 2000 fails to address the issues involving domain names, and the rights, and liabilities of domain owners.
    
- Despite the prevalence of copyright and patent issues in India, the Act still does not protect Intellectual Property Rights when it comes to computer programs and networks.
    
- Various kinds of cybercrimes such as cyberstalking, cyber fraud, chat room abuse, theft of internet hours, and many more are not covered by this Act.
    
- The IT Act has also failed to address critical issues such as privacy and content regulation.
    

With the rapid escalation of cybercrime cases in India, there emerged an urgent need for a mechanism to detect and control them. The IT Act 2000 is a step towards safeguarding the data and sensitive information stored with online intermediaries. In addition, this Act comes with various provisions that benefit citizens and protect their data from misuse.
