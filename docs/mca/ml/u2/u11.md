# Chapter 3: Modelling and Evaluation

A machine learning algorithm builds its cognitive capability by developing a mathematical formulation, or **target function**, based on the features in the input data.

However, this process is not fully autonomous. Just as a child learning a new skill needs guidance, an algorithm requires human-provided, **non-learnable parameters**, known as **hyperparameters**. These parameters (e.g., the 'k' in k-Nearest Neighbors) are essential for guiding the model and ensuring its success.

## 3.2 Selecting a Model

**Modelling** is the process of transforming raw input data into a structured, meaningful pattern, which is represented by the model's "target function" which is appropriate for the machine learning task.

The first major challenge in a machine learning project is selecting the appropriate model. This is often called the **"first dilemma"** of machine learning.

#### The "No Free Lunch" Theorem

This selection process is a dilemma because of a concept known as the **"No Free Lunch" (NFL) theorem**.

- **Core Concept:** The NFL theorem states that **no single model works best for every machine learning problem**.
    
- **Assumptions Matter:** Every learning model simplifies the real world based on a set of underlying **assumptions**. A model's effectiveness depends entirely on whether its assumptions hold true for your specific problem and data characteristics.
    
- **Consequence:** A model that produces remarkable results in one situation (e.g., on image data) might fail completely in another (e.g., on text data).
    
- **Solution:** This is why thorough **data exploration** is a critical prerequisite. Data's characteristics must be understood and align them with the specific problem _before_ choosing a model whose assumptions align with that data.
    

The broadest category for model selection is based on the primary learning objective: **predictive** (Supervised Learning) or **descriptive** (Unsupervised Learning).


## Model Selection: Predictive vs. Descriptive

|**Feature**|**Predictive Model**|**Descriptive Model**|
|---|---|---|
|**Learning Type**|Supervised Learning|Unsupervised Learning|
|**Primary Goal**|**Prediction:** Forecast a specific value or class.|**Discovery:** Find hidden patterns, groups, or insights.|
|**Target Feature**|**Yes.** The model maps inputs ($X$) to a known output ($Y$).|**No.** The model analyzes all input features ($X$) to find structures.|
|**Example Tasks**|Classification, Regression.|Clustering, Association Analysis.|
|**Example Question**|"What will the stock price be tomorrow?"|"What natural customer segments exist in my data?"|

### 3.2.1 Predictive Models (Supervised Learning)

Predictive models are the foundation of **supervised learning**. Their primary objective is to **predict a specific target value** using an input dataset.

- **Goal:** To infer how a **target feature** (the output) changes based on one or more **predictor features** (the inputs).
    
- **Example:** Predicting criminal incidents (target) based on average income and population density (predictors).
    
- **Sub-types:**
    
    - **Classification:** The target feature is categorical (e.g., "Malignant" or "Benign").
        
    - **Regression:** The target feature is numerical (e.g., "Price" or "Temperature").
        
- **Versatility:** Some advanced models, such as **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** and **Neural Networks**, are versatile enough to be used for both classification and regression tasks.
    
### 3.2.2 Descriptive Models (Unsupervised Learning)

Descriptive models are the foundation of **unsupervised learning**. Their primary objective is to **discover hidden patterns or gain insights** from a dataset.

- **Goal:** To describe a dataset by finding natural groupings or associations.
    
- **Mechanism:** These models operate with **no target feature** or single feature of interest. They derive patterns based on the values and relationships of **all features** together.
    
- **Sub-types:** A key example is **clustering models**, which group together similar data instances (similar values across different features) based on their feature values.
    

## Factors Influencing Model Choice

Beyond the high-level predictive vs. descriptive split, several practical factors guide the selection of a _specific_ algorithm:

1. **The Specific Problem:** What question are you trying to answer?
    
    - **Classification:** Are you predicting a class? (e.g., _Is this tumor malignant or benign?_)
        
    - **Regression:** Are you predicting a number? (e.g., _What is the expected stock price?_)
        
    - **Clustering:** Are you looking for groups? (e.g., _What are my customer segments?_)
        
    - **Association:** Are you looking for relationships? (e.g., _What items are bought together?_)
        
2. **Nature of the Input Data:**
    
    - What are the data types (categorical, numerical, text, image)?
        
    - How much data is available? (Some models, like deep learning, require massive datasets).
        
    - What is the data quality? (Are there many missing values? Are there outliers?).
        
3. **Problem Domain and Constraints:**
    
    - **Interpretability:** Does the model's decision need to be explained? (e.g., a bank must explain why a loan was denied, making a "black box" model like a neural network difficult to use).
        
    - **Performance:** What are the operational needs? Does the model need to be extremely fast (e.g., real-time fraud detection), or is batch processing acceptable?
