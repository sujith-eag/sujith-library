# Data Structures and Attribute Types in Machine Learning

Understanding the structure of input data is a fundamental concept in machine learning. This begins with defining the components of a dataset and the various types of data (attributes) encountered.

## Dataset Fundamentals

A **data set** is a collection of related information or records, typically pertaining to a specific entity or subject area (e.g., student records, product sales).

- **Record:** Each row in a data set is a **record** (also called an _instance_, _observation_, or _sample_).
    
- **Attribute:** Each column represents an **attribute**, which provides information on a specific characteristic of the record. Attributes are also commonly referred to as **features**, **variables**, **dimensions**, or **fields**.
    

Data attributes are broadly classified in two primary ways:

1. Based on their measurement scale (Qualitative vs. Quantitative).
    
2. Based on the number of values they can assume (Discrete vs. Continuous).

### Classification 1: By Measurement Scale (Data Types)

This classification is based on the nature and properties of the values.

#### Hierarchy of Data Types

- **Attributes**
    - **Qualitative (Categorical)**
        - Nominal
        - Ordinal
            
    - **Quantitative (Numerical)**
        - Interval
        - Ratio
            
#### A. Qualitative (Categorical) Data

Qualitative data, also known as **categorical data**, describes a quality or characteristic. It provides information that cannot be measured on a numerical scale.

Qualitative data is further subdivided based on whether the data can be logically ordered:

1. **Nominal Data :** This data consists of named values (labels) that cannot be logically ordered, quantified or ranked. Mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, etc.) cannot be performed on nominal data.
    - Blood Type (A, B, AB, O), Gender (Male, Female), Zip Code, Student Name.
            
2. **Ordinal Data :** This data consists of named values that can be naturally ordered or ranked. We can determine if one value is greater than or better than another, but the precise difference between values is not defined.
    - Student Grades (A, B, C, D), Performance Quality (Good, Average, Poor), Customer Rating (1-5 stars).
        
> Special Case: **Dichotomous Data**: A subtype of nominal data where only two labels are possible (e.g., Pass/Fail, Yes/No, True/False).

##### Measures of Central Tendency for Qualitative Data

- **Nominal Data:** Since no ordering or math is possible, only the **mode** (most frequently occurring value) can be calculated.
    
- **Ordinal Data:** Because the data can be counted and ordered, both the **mode** and the **median** (the middle value) can be identified, along with quartiles. The **mean** cannot be calculated.
    

#### B. Quantitative (Numerical) Data

Quantitative data, also known as **numerical data**, represents information that **can be measured** on a specific numerical scale.

Quantitative data is subdivided based on the properties of the measurement scale:

1. **Interval Data :** This is numerical data where the order is known and the difference between values is meaningful and consistent. However, interval data has no true zero point.
    - Temperature (Celsius or Fahrenheit), Dates, Time.
    
2. **Ratio Data :** This is numerical data where the order is known, the difference between values is meaningful, and there is a true zero point. The "true zero" indicates the complete absence of the attribute.
    - Age, Salary, Weight, Height, Price.
        
    - **Operations:** All mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division/ratios) are valid.
	
> Note on "True Zero":
> 
> Interval data lacks a "true zero." For example, 0°C does not mean the absence of temperature; it is just another point on the scale.
> 
> Therefore, while addition and subtraction are valid (e.g., 40°C = 20°C + 20°C), ratios are not. We cannot say 40°C is "twice as hot" as 20°C.

### Classification 2: By Count (Value Types)

Attributes can also be categorized based on the number of values they can assume.

|**Attribute Type**|**Description**|**Examples**|**Relation to Measurement Scale**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Discrete**|Can assume a **finite or countably infinite** number of values.|Nominal attributes, ordinal attributes, or numerical counts (e.g., "number of children").|**Nominal and ordinal attributes are always discrete.**|
|**Binary**|A specialized discrete attribute that can assume **only two values**.|Male/Female, Positive/Negative, Yes/No.|N/A (A specialized form of discrete data)|
|**Continuous**|Can assume **any real-number value** within a given range.|Length, Height, Weight, Price, Temperature.|**Interval and ratio attributes are generally continuous**, with some exceptions (e.g., a "count" is ratio data but is discrete).|

### Importance of Data Typing and the Data Dictionary

It is crucial to correctly identify attributes as numeric or categorical because the approach used for data exploration, pre-processing, and modeling is fundamentally different for each type.

#### The Data Dictionary

In a standard project, a **data dictionary** should be available for reference. A data dictionary is a metadata repository that provides detailed information on each attribute, including:

- Its description
    
- Data type (e.g., nominal, ratio, integer, string)
    
- Allowed values
    
- Other relevant details
    

If a data dictionary is not available, standard library functions within a machine learning tool (e.g., `info()` in pandas) must be used to infer these details.

#### Common Data Repository

The UCI (University of California, Irvine) Machine Learning Repository is a well-known collection of over 400 datasets that serve as benchmarks for researchers and practitioners in the machine learning community.
