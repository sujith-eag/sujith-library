# Phases of a Machine Learning

A **machine learning workflow** outlines the typical phases and activities involved in a project, forming a foundational methodology. While the specific activities vary based on the learning context (supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement), a generalized process can be established.

This workflow is generally divided into four primary phases:

1. Data Preparation
    
2. Learning and Modeling
    
3. Performance Evaluation
    
4. Performance Improvement
    
The process begins with the **data**. 
* For **supervised learning**, this involves a labeled training dataset and unlabeled test data. 
* Conversely, **unsupervised learning** relies on unlabeled data, as its primary goal is to discover inherent patterns within the dataset.

### Phase 1: Data Preparation (Exploration and Pre-processing)

This initial phase focuses on exploring and preparing the data to ensure its quality and suitability for modeling. The success of a machine learning model is highly dependent on the **quality of the data**.

Typical preparation activities include:

1. **Data Type Identification:** Understand the types of data (e.g., categorical, numerical, text) in the dataset.
    
2. **Data Exploration:** Analyze the data to understand its statistical properties, distributions, and quality.
    
3. **Relationship Exploration:** Investigate relationships between data elements, such as inter-feature correlations.
    
4. **Issue Identification:** Detect potential problems such as missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies.
    
5. **Data Remediation:** Perform corrective actions, such as imputing missing values or removing outliers.
    
6. **Data Pre-processing:** Apply necessary transformations, such as normalization, scaling, or one-hot encoding.
    
Data exploration helps uncover problems like missing values or outliers (data elements with surprisingly different values from others).

### Phase 2: Learning and Modeling

Once the data is prepared, the learning tasks commence. This phase involves selecting, training, and applying models.

Typical activities in this phase include:

1. **Data Splitting:** Partitioning the prepared data into **training** and **testing** (or holdout) sets. This step is primarily applicable to supervised learning.
    
2. **Model Selection:** Evaluating and choosing appropriate learning algorithms for the task.
    
3. **Training and Application:**
    
    - For **supervised learning**, the selected model is trained using the labeled training data. The process of fitting a model to a dataset is known as **model training**.
        
    - For **unsupervised learning**, the chosen model is applied directly to the input data to identify patterns.
        
4. **Prediction/Application:** The trained model is applied to new, unknown data (e.g., the test set) to generate predictions or classifications.

### Phase 3: Performance Evaluation

After the model is applied, its effectiveness and accuracy must be rigorously assessed. This step determines whether the model's outputs are valid and reliable.

The primary activities involve:

- **Metric-Based Assessment:** Evaluating the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
    
    - **For classification:** This may include using a **confusion matrix**, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or visualizing trade-offs with **ROC curves**.
        
    - **For regression:** Common metrics include Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
        
- **Effectiveness Analysis:** Determining if the model training (supervised) or grouping (unsupervised) was successful and meets the project's objectives.

### Phase 4: Performance Improvement

Based on the results of the evaluation, the model's performance may require enhancement. This is an iterative process of refinement.

Common improvement strategies include:

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Adjusting the model's internal settings (hyperparameters) to optimize performance.
    
- **Feature Engineering:** Modifying, selecting, or creating new features from the existing data to improve the model's predictive power.
    
- **Model Re-selection:** If performance is unsatisfactory, it may be necessary to revisit Phase 2 and select a different model or algorithm.
