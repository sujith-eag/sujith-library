# Requirements Engineering Processes

## I. Requirements Engineering (RE) Fundamentals

### A. Key Definitions

- **Requirements Engineering (RE):** The process of **finding out, analyzing, documenting, and checking** the services and constraints of a system. It involves understanding and defining what services are required from the system and identifying the constraints on its operation and development.

- **Requirements Document:** The outcome of the RE process; an **agreed requirements document** that specifies a system satisfying stakeholder requirements.

- **Feasibility Study:** A short, focused study that takes place early in the RE process to assess if the system contributes to organizational objectives, can be implemented within schedule/budget/technology, and can be integrated with existing systems.

### B. Core Concepts and Principles

- **Criticality:** Requirements engineering is a particularly **critical stage** of the software process, as errors or mistakes made early inevitably lead to later problems in system design and implementation.

- **Iterative Nature:** Requirements engineering is typically an **iterative process** in which the main activities are interleaved. The activities are often organized around a **spiral model**.

- **Stakeholder Needs:** Requirements are usually presented at two levels of detail: a high-level statement for **end-users and customers**, and a detailed **system specification** for developers.

## II. The Overall Requirements Engineering Process

The overall RE process consists of three core, interleaved activities, often following a spiral model structure.

### A. Process Steps (Main Activities)

1. **Requirements Elicitation and Analysis:** Discovering requirements by interacting with stakeholders to understand the domain, services, and constraints.

2. **Requirements Specification:** Converting the gathered requirements into a standard, formal document.

3. **Requirements Validation:** Checking that the requirements accurately define the system the customer truly wants.

### B. Phasing of Effort (The Spiral Model)

The amount of time and effort dedicated to each activity changes across iterations (the rings of the spiral):

- **Early in the process (Inner Rings):** Most effort is spent on understanding **high-level business** and **non-functional requirements**, and abstract user requirements.

- **Later in the process (Outer Rings):** More effort is dedicated to eliciting and understanding detailed system requirements and specialized non-functional requirements.

This spiral model accommodates approaches to development where the requirements are developed to different levels of detail. The number of iterations around the spiral can vary so that the spiral can be exited after some or all of the user requirements have been elicited.

## III. Activity 1: Requirements Elicitation and Analysis

The process of deriving system requirements through observation of existing systems, discussions with potential users and procurers, task analysis, and other techniques.

### A. Goal and Definition

- **Goal:** To understand the work that stakeholders do and how they might use a new system to support that work. 

* software engineers work with stakeholders to find out about the application domain, work activities, the services and system features that stakeholders want, the required performance of the system, hardware constraints, and so on.

### B. The Elicitation and Analysis Sub-Process Steps

Elicitation and analysis is itself an iterative process cycle with continual feedback between stages:

1. **Requirements Discovery and Understanding:** Gathering information by interacting with stakeholders, as well as finding domain requirements from existing documentation and systems.

2. **Requirements Classification and Organization:** Taking the initial unstructured collection of information and grouping related requirements into coherent clusters. 
    - **Key Technique (Viewpoints):** Organizing requirements by **viewpoint**, where a viewpoint is a way of collecting and organizing requirements from a group of stakeholders who share something in common (e.g., end-users or managers).

3. **Requirements Prioritization and Negotiation:** Resolving conflicts among stakeholders’ varying views to reach agreed-upon compromise requirements. 
	- **Regular stakeholder meetings** are necessary to allow concerns to be expressed and agreements made, which prevents stakeholders from undermining the RE process.

4. **Requirements Documentation:** Recording the requirements, which may result in an early draft of the formal document or simply involve maintaining the information informally on wikis or whiteboards.

### C. Key Elicitation Techniques

1. **Interviewing:** Talking directly to stakeholders to gather information. Engineers should be open-minded, and avoid preconceived ideas and use **springboard questions** or prototypes to prompt discussion, as simply asking "what they want" is rarely effective.

2. **Observation / Ethnography:** Watching people perform their jobs to observe what artifacts and systems they use. This technique is valuable for discovering requirements derived from **cooperation and awareness** of others’ activities that users may not articulate (e.g., an air traffic controller adjusting strategy based on neighboring sectors’ activities).
    - **Integration:** Ethnography can be combined with the development of a **system prototype**; the ethnography informs the prototype, and the prototype focuses the ethnography by generating new questions.

3. **Scenarios and User Stories:** High-level, natural language narratives used to facilitate discussions and propose requirements. Scenarios describe possible uses of the system and help visualize how users might interact with the product.

    - **Example (iLearn):** A user story describing a teacher (Jack) using the digital learning environment for a class project can elicit requirements, such as the need for a **photo-sharing site** and a **wiki**,.


## IV. Activity 2: Requirements Specification

### A. Goal and Output

- **Goal:** To translate the gathered information into a precise document. The resulting **Software Requirements Document (SRD)** should ideally be clear, unambiguous, easy to understand, complete, and consistent, although this is practically impossible for large systems.

- **Content:** The specification includes two primary types of requirements:
    - **User requirements:** Abstract statements for customers and end-users, typically written in natural language.
    - **System requirements:** Detailed functional and non-functional descriptions for developers; they may be written using more formal notations.

### B. Notations Used

Different notations are suitable for different audiences and levels of detail:

- **Natural Language Sentences:** Requirements are written as numbered sentences, with each sentence expressing one requirement.

- **Structured Natural Language:** Requirements are written using a standard form or template, where fields provide specific information about the requirement. This reduces variability and imposes uniformity.

- **Graphical Notations (e.g., UML):** Models like use case and sequence diagrams are used to define functional requirements, supplemented by text.

- **Mathematical Specifications:** Notations based on formal concepts (like finite-state machines). These are unambiguous but difficult for most customers to understand.

## V. Activity 3: Requirements Validation

- Requirements validation is the process of checking that the requirements define the system that the customer **really wants**. It involves finding problems with the requirements.

### A. Goal and Importance

- **Goal:** To check that the requirements define the system the customer **really wants**. This involves ensuring the requirements are realistic, consistent, and complete.

- **Consequence of Failure:** Errors in the requirements document, if discovered late, can lead to **extensive rework costs** during development or after system deployment..

- **Role in Dependable Processes:** Requirements reviews are included in dependable processes to check that requirements are, as far as possible, complete and consistent.

### B. Validation Checks (5 key Dimensions)

Requirements validation involves assessing the documents against specific quality criteria :

1. **Validity Checks:** Ensuring the requirements cover the **true needs** and requirements of the stakeholders.

2. **Consistency Checks:** Ensuring that there are no contradictions or conflicting descriptions of the same function or constraints within the document.

3. **Completeness Checks:** Ensuring all required constraints and functions intended by the user are fully defined.

4. **Realism Checks:** Using knowledge of the existing technology, proposed budget, and schedule to ensure that the requirements **can be implemented**.

5. **Verifiability:** Ensuring requirements are written so that a **set of tests can be objectively designed** to demonstrate that the delivered system meets each specified requirement, thereby reducing potential disputes.

### C. Validation Techniques

- **Requirements Reviews:** Systematic analysis of the requirements by a team of reviewers to find errors and inconsistencies.

- **Prototyping:** Developing an executable model of the system for end-users and customers to interact with. Their feedback helps identify necessary requirements changes and unmet expectations.

## VI. Requirements Management

### A. Core Concept

- **Requirements Management:** The process of **managing changes** to the requirements of a system software. 

- **Inherent Change:** Requirements inevitably change due to evolving customer priorities, new business goals, or changes in the development team's understanding.
- The organization buying the system changes, the people involved develop a better understanding of what they want, or the hardware, software, and organizational environment are modified.

- **Goal:** Changes must be managed to understand their **impact** on other requirements and the associated cost and time implications,.

### B. Requirements Management Planning

During the planning stage, the following key issues must be established,:

1. **Requirements Identification:** Each requirement must be given a **unique identifier** to enable cross-referencing and use in traceability assessments.

2. **Change Management Process:** Defining the set of activities used to assess the **impact and cost** of proposed changes.

3. **Traceability Policies:** Defining how **relationships** between requirements, their sources, and the system design should be recorded and maintained,. Traceability records are crucial for analyzing the impact of proposed changes.

4. **Identification:** Each requirement must be uniquely identified to allow for effective cross-referencing and traceability assessments.

5. **Tool Support:** Automated tools are necessary for managing the large amounts of information involved, simplifying the process of change management and traceability management,. These tools can range from specialized requirements management systems (like DOORS) to shared spreadsheets and simple database systems,.

### B. Requirements Change Management Process

A formal change management process should be applied to all proposed changes after the requirements document has been approved to ensure consistency and justification for changes.

1. **Problem Analysis and Change Specification:** Identifying a problem in the existing requirements and proposing a precise change to address it.
    - A system stakeholder submits a **change request** (e.g., a bug report or a request for new functionality).
    - The problem is identified, and a precise change proposal is specified.

2. **Change Analysis and Costing:** Assessing the impact of the proposed change on other requirements, design elements, and estimating the cost and time needed for implementation.
    - The **Change Control Board (CCB)** or product development staff determines the validity of the change, its priority, and whether it should be selected for implementation.

3. **Change Implementation:** The requirements document, and subsequently the system design and implementation, are modified. 
    - **Document Changeability:** The requirements document should be structured modularly to minimize external references and extensive rewriting, ensuring that individual sections can be changed and replaced without affecting others.
