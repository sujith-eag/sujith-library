# Functional and Non-functional Requirements

## I. Requirements Engineering Fundamentals

### A. Core Concepts and Definitions

* **Requirements** : Descriptions of the services a system should provide and the **constraints** on its operation. They reflect the needs of customers for a system that serves a specific purpose (e.g., finding information or controlling a device).

* **Requirements Engineering (RE)** : The process of finding out, analyzing, documenting, and checking these services and constraints.

### B. Levels of Requirements Specification

Requirements are typically presented at different levels of detail to communicate information effectively to various readers.

#### User Requirements Specification

- **Purpose:** To describe the functional and nonfunctional requirements in a way that is **understandable by system users** and customers/end-user who lack detailed technical knowledge.
- Abstract statements of the system requirements written in natural language.
- **Content Focus:** Should specify **only the external behavior** of the system.
- **Required Style:** Must be written in **natural language**, supplemented by simple diagrams and tables, and should avoid software jargon, structured notations, or formal notations.

#### System Requirements Specification

- **Purpose:** Expanded versions of user requirements. More detailed descriptions of the software system’s functions, services, inputs, outputs and operational constraints. (sometimes called a _functional specification_)
- Used by software engineers as the **starting point for system design**. They may be used as part of the contract for system implementation.
- **Content Focus:** Should ideally describe only the external behavior and operational constraints of the system. However, some initial design information (like a proposed architecture) may be included to help structure the specification, especially for complex systems.

### C. The Relationship Between Requirement Types

The distinction between functional and non-functional requirements is not always clear-cut.

- **Interdependence:** Requirements are not independent; often, one type of requirement will generate or constrain the definition of another.

- **Example (Security):** A user requirement concerned with security (often seen as non-functional) might state a constraint on system use (e.g., limiting access to authorized users). When detailed further, this constraint generates clear functional requirements, such as the necessity to include specific user authentication facilities.

## II. Functional Requirements (FRs)

### A. Key Definition and Scope

- **Definition:** Functional requirements are explicit **statements of services the system should provide**. This includes defining how the system must react to inputs and behave in particular situations. They may also explicitly define what the system should **not** do.

- **Dependency:** FRs depend on the type of software being developed, the expected users, and the general approach the organization takes when documenting requirements.

- **Information Requirements:** If an organization plans to use an existing off-the-shelf software product, the focus of specification shifts from functional requirements to **information requirements**, which define the necessary information needed, and how it is to be delivered and organized for users.

### B. Quality Attributes of Functional Requirements

Ideally, a functional requirements specification should be both complete and consistent.

- **Completeness:** This means that all services and information required by the user should be defined.

- **Consistency:** This means that requirements should not be contradictory.

- _**Core Concept: Achieving these ideals is complex.**_ It is often only possible for very small systems because:
    1. Mistakes and omissions are easy to make in large, complex systems.
    2. Large systems involve many stakeholders with different, often inconsistent, needs and expectations.
- **Risk of Imprecision:** Ambiguous or imprecise requirements lead to disputes, delays, and cost increases because system developers may interpret vague requirements in a way that simplifies implementation, which frequently conflicts with the customer’s true intentions.

### C. Key Examples

Functional requirements for the Mentcare system (Mental Health Care Patient Management System) include:

- "A user **shall be able to search** the appointments lists for all clinics."
- "The system **shall generate each day**, for each clinic, a list of patients who are expected to attend appointments that day."
- "Each staff member using the system **shall be uniquely identified** by his or her eight-digit employee number."

## III. Non-functional Requirements (NFRs)

### A. Key Definition and Characteristics

- **Definition:** Non-functional requirements are **constraints** on the services or functions delivered by the system. They usually apply to the **system as a whole** rather than specific individual features.

- **Scope:** NFRs specify or constrain characteristics related to **emergent system properties** (e.g., reliability, response time, and memory use). They also cover constraints on the development process, standards adherence, and implementation details (e.g., I/O device capabilities).

- **System Impact:** NFRs often affect the overall architecture of the system, and their implementation may be **spread throughout the system** instead of being confined to individual components.

### B. Sources and Classification

NFRs are classified into three main groups based on where the requirement originates:

1. **Product Requirements:** Specify or constrain the **runtime behavior** of the software.
    - _Examples:_ Performance (speed, memory required), Reliability (acceptable failure rate), Security, and Usability requirements.

2. **Organizational Requirements:** Derived from **policies and procedures** in the customer’s and developer’s organizations.
    - _Examples:_ Operational process requirements (defining system use) and Development process requirements (specifying development methods or tools).

3. **External Requirements:** Derived from factors external to the system and development process.
    - _Examples:_ Regulatory, ethical, and legislative requirements (e.g., privacy laws, safety regulations).

### C. Quantitative Specification and Metrics

Verifiability: NFRs should be written **quantitatively** whenever possible so that they can be objectively tested. This allows measuring the characteristics during testing to check for compliance.

#### Metrics for Quantifiable NFRs: 

Several characteristics and metrics that can be used for objective testing:

* **Robustness** : Time to restart after failure, Probability of data corruption on failure.

* **Reliability :** Mean time to failure (MTTF), Rate of occurrence of failure (ROCOF).

* **Safety :** Probability of failure on demand (POFOD).

* **Size :** Memory required, Chip area.
* **Availability**  : Availability (AVAIL), expressed as a percentage of operational time.
	* The probability that a system will be operational when a demand is made for service 
	* 0.9999 means unavailable for 8.4 seconds in a 24-hour period.

* **Speed/Efficiency** (Performance) : Processed transactions/second, User/event response time, Screen refresh time.

- **Usability:** Training time required, or the average number of errors made by experienced users per hour of system use.

**Usability Example (Goal to Requirement):** 
* A general goal, such as "Medical staff should be able to use the system easily," is not testable. 
* It can be rewritten as a verifiable requirement: "Medical staff shall be able to use all the system functions after two hours of training. After this training, the average number of errors made by experienced users shall not exceed two per hour of system use".

### D. Key Examples (Mentcare System)

- **Product Requirement (Availability):** "The Mentcare system shall be available to all clinics during normal working hours (Mon–Fri, 08:30–17:30). **Downtime** within normal working hours shall **not exceed 5 seconds in any one day**".
- **Organizational Requirement (Authentication):** "Users of the Mentcare system shall identify themselves using their health authority identity card".
- **External Requirement (Privacy):** "The system shall implement patient privacy provisions as set out in HStan-03-2006-priv".

**Analogy for Understanding:** Think of designing a high-performance race car.

- **Functional Requirements** are the car's basic services which define **what** the car does : 
	- "It must accelerate from 0 to 60 mph," 
	- "It must brake when the pedal is pressed," and 
	- "It must turn when the steering wheel is turned."

- **Non-functional Requirements** are the constraints and quality attributes which define **how well** or under **what restrictions** the car performs its functions : 
	- "The car must have an _Availability_ (NFR, product) of 99.9% during the race," 
	- "It must be constructed using _Organization_ standards (NFR, organizational) set by the company," and 
	- "It must not exceed 90 decibels of noise (NFR, external/regulatory)."
