# Structural Models

Structural models display the **organization of a system** in terms of its component parts and their relationships. They are fundamental representations used when discussing and designing the system architecture.

## Static vs. Dynamic Models

Structural models can be categorized into two main types:

- **Static Models**: Show the organization of the system design, focusing on components like object classes and their relationships.
    
- **Dynamic Models**: Show the organization of the system executing, reflecting structures such as interacting threads.
    

> [!NOTE] Architectural Context
> 
> Although UML has component, package, and deployment diagrams for architectural modeling, the core of this section focuses on Class Diagrams to detail the static structure of objects.

## Class Diagrams

Class diagrams show the classes in a system and the **associations** (links) between them.

- **Object Class**: A general definition of one kind of system object. In early stages, these represent real-world entities (e.g., patient, doctor).
    
- **Association**: A link indicating a relationship, often requiring one class to have knowledge of the other.
    

### Class Structure Detail

Classes are represented by a **rectangle** divided into three sections:

1. **Top Section**: The **name** of the object class.
    
2. **Middle Section**: The class **attributes** (data fields).
    
3. **Lower Section**: The **operations** (methods) associated with the class.
    

### Multiplicity (Associations)

Multiplicity indicates how many objects are involved in an association.

|**Symbol**|**Meaning**|**Example**|
|---|---|---|
|`1`|Exactly one object|A patient has exactly one record.|
|`1..*`|One or more objects|A patient attends one or more consultations.|
|`*`|An indefinite number|General indefinite relationship.|

### Example: Associations and Multiplicity

The following diagram represents classes and associations in the Mentcare system, showing how a `Patient` interacts with various entities, such as `Consultation`, `Condition`, and `Hospital Doctor`.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Patient {
        
    }
    class PatientRecord {
        
    }
    class Condition {
    }
    class Consultation {
    }
    class HospitalDoctor {
    }
    class GeneralPractitioner {
    }

    Patient "1" -- "1" PatientRecord : maintains_record_about
    Patient "1..*" -- "1..*" Condition : diagnosed-with
    Patient "1..*" -- "1..*" Consultation : attends
    Patient "1" -- "1..*" HospitalDoctor : referred-to
    Patient "1" -- "1..*" GeneralPractitioner : referred-by

    Consultation "1..*" -- "1..*" Condition : involves
    Consultation "1..*" -- "1..*" HospitalDoctor : prescribes
    Consultation "1..*" -- "1..*" GeneralPractitioner : prescribes

    HospitalDoctor "1..*" -- "1..4" Treatment
```

### Example: Attributes and Operations

This diagram details the `Consultation` class, showing the specific attributes and operations.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Consultation {
        + Doctors
        + Date
        + Time
        + Clinic
        + Reason
        + Medication_prescribed
        + Treatment_prescribed
        + Voice_notes
        + Transcript

        + New()
        + Prescribe()
        + RecordNotes()
        + Transcribe()
    }
```

## Generalization

Generalization (often called inheritance) allows the system to define hierarchies of classes.

- **Mechanism**: Attributes and operations in the higher-level classes (superclasses) are automatically associated with lower-level classes (subclasses).
    
- **Notation**: An **arrowhead pointing up** toward the more general class.

A `General practitioner` and `Hospital doctor` are specialized types of `Doctor`. Furthermore, `Hospital doctor` is specialized into `Consultant`, `Team doctor`, and `Trainee doctor`.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    direction BT
    class Doctor {
        + Name
        + Phone_#
        + Email
        + register()
        + de-register()
    }

    class GeneralPractitioner {
        + Practice_Address
    }

    class HospitalDoctor {
        + Staff_#
        + Pager_#
    }

    class Consultant
    class TeamDoctor
    class TraineeDoctor

    GeneralPractitioner --|> Doctor
    HospitalDoctor --|> Doctor

    Consultant --|> HospitalDoctor
    TeamDoctor --|> HospitalDoctor
    TraineeDoctor --|> HospitalDoctor
```

## Aggregation

Aggregation is a type of association used to illustrate when objects are made up of different parts.

- **Definition**: One object (the **whole**) is composed of other objects (the **parts**).
    
- **Notation**: A **diamond shape** is added to the link next to the class representing the whole.
    

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class PatientRecord {
    }
    class Patient {
    }
    class Consultation {
    }

    PatientRecord "1" --o "1" Patient : aggregates
    PatientRecord "1" --o "1..*" Consultation : aggregates
```

> - What are **structural models**? Explain **class diagrams** with an example.
> - Describe **multiplicity**, **generalization**, **aggregation**, and **associations** in class diagrams.
> - Give an example class diagram for an ATM or a language-processing system.
