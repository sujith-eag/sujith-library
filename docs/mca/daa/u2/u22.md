# Brute_Force String Matching

### Explain the Brute-Force String Matching algorithm. 

The Brute-Force String Matching problem involves finding a substring within a larger string (called the text) that matches a given string (called the pattern). 

More precisely, the goal is to find the index of the leftmost character in the text where the first matching substring begins. 

Brute-force, approach to solving this problem involves aligning the pattern against the first _m_ characters of the text (where _m_ is the length of the pattern) and then comparing the corresponding pairs of characters from left to right. If all _m_ pairs match, the algorithm can stop, indicating a successful search. If a mismatching pair is encountered, the pattern is shifted one position to the right, and character comparisons resume, starting again with the first character of the pattern and its new counterpart in the text. This process continues, with the algorithm checking alignments until the pattern extends beyond the text. The last possible position in the text where a matching substring can start is _n_ - _m_ (assuming text positions are indexed from 0 to _n_ - 1, where _n_ is the text length).
    

### Write an algorithm or pseudocode for the Brute-Force String Matching technique. 

Here is the pseudocode for the Brute-Force String Matching algorithm:

```
ALGORITHM BruteForceStringMatch(T[0..n − 1], P[0..m − 1])
//Implements brute-force string matching
//Input: An array T[0..n − 1] of n characters representing a text and
// an array P[0..m − 1] of m characters representing a pattern
//Output: The index of the first character in the text that starts a
// matching substring or −1 if the search is unsuccessful

for i ← 0 to n − m do
	j ← 0
	while j < m and P[j] = T[i + j] do
		j ← j + 1
	if j = m 
		return i
return −1
```

### Analyze the time complexity of the Brute-Force String Matching algorithm. 

The analysis of the brute-force string-matching algorithm focuses on the number of character comparisons. The input consists of a text of length _n_ and a pattern of length _m_ (where _m_ ≤ _n_). 

The basic operation is the comparison `P[j] = T[i + j]`.

In the **worst case**, the algorithm might have to make all _m_ comparisons before shifting the pattern. This can happen for each of the _n_ - _m_ + 1 possible alignments of the pattern within the text. 

An example of a worst-case input is patterns and texts where mismatches always occur on the last character of the pattern. In this scenario, for each of the _n - m + 1_ alignments, the algorithm performs _m_ comparisons (m-1 successful, 1 unsuccessful) before shifting. 

Thus, the total number of character comparisons in the worst case is **m(n - m + 1)**, which puts the algorithm in the **O(nm)** efficiency class.

For searching in a **typical natural language text**, however, most shifts are expected to occur after very few comparisons. Therefore, the **average-case efficiency** is considerably better than the worst-case efficiency. 

For searching in random texts, the average-case efficiency has been shown to be **linear, i.e., Θ(n)**.

### Trace the Brute-Force String Matching algorithm for the following scenarios:

- Pattern: `"COMPUTER"`, Text: `"MASTER OF COMPUTER APPLICATIONS"`
	
	- Text (T): `MASTER OF COMPUTER APPLICATIONS` (n=29, indexing from 0 to 28)
	- Pattern (P): `COMPUTER` (m=8, indexing from 0 to 7)
	- The loop for `i` runs from 0 to n - m = 29 - 8 = 21.

## Exhaustive Search

### Define "Exhaustive Search" as an approach to problem-solving. (How does it relate to Brute force strategy) 

Exhaustive search is simply a brute-force approach to combinatorial problems. It involves generating each and every element of the problem domain, selecting those of them that satisfy all the constraints, and then finding a desired element (e.g., the one that optimizes some objective function). 

Brute force itself is defined as a straightforward approach to solving a problem, usually directly based on the problem statement and definitions of the concepts involved. Thus, Exhaustive search is a specific application of the general brute-force strategy tailored for problems that require searching through a large number of combinatorial objects.

### Discuss the primary limitations of using Exhaustive Search for solving complex combinatorial problems. 

The primary limitation of exhaustive search is its **extreme inefficiency on most inputs**. This difficulty stems from the fact that the **number of combinatorial objects (like permutations or subsets) typically grows extremely fast with a problem’s size**, often exponentially or faster. 

For problems like the Traveling Salesperson Problem, the number of permutations grows as n! (factorial of the number of cities). 

For the Knapsack problem, the number of subsets is 2^n (2 raised to the power of the number of items). This rapid growth means that even for moderate-sized instances, the number of objects to generate and check becomes astronomically large, reaching "unimaginable magnitudes". 

Consequently, **exhaustive search is impractical for all but very small instances of the problems it can be applied to**. For many such problems, there are no known algorithms that can solve them exactly in an acceptable amount of time, leading to the belief by most computer scientists that such efficient algorithms do not exist. 

Problems like TSP and the 0/1 Knapsack are classic examples of these computationally hard problems, known as NP-hard problems.


### Demonstrate the use of Exhaustive Search for the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) with a suitable example. 

The Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) asks to find the shortest tour through a given set of _n_ cities that visits each city exactly once before returning to the starting city. 

It can be modeled by a weighted graph where vertices are cities and edge weights are distances. 

The problem becomes finding the shortest Hamiltonian circuit in the graph. 

The exhaustive-search approach for TSP involves generating all permutations of the cities, calculating the total tour length for each permutation, and then finding the shortest tour among them. 

Consider the small instance with four cities (a, b, c, d) and given edge weights. We can fix city 'a' as the starting point without loss of generality. We then generate all permutations of the remaining _n_-1 cities (b, c, d). 

For n=4, there are (4-1)! = 3! = 6 permutations of cities b, c, d. These permutations define the possible tours starting and ending at 'a':

- a -> b -> c -> d -> a. Tour length: 2 + 8 + 1 + 7 = 18
- a -> b -> d -> c -> a. Tour length: 2 + 3 + 1 + 5 = 11
- a -> c -> b -> d -> a. Tour length: 5 + 8 + 3 + 7 = 23
- a -> c -> d -> b -> a. Tour length: 5 + 1 + 3 + 2 = 11
- a -> d -> b -> c -> a. Tour length: 7 + 3 + 8 + 5 = 23
- a -> d -> c -> b -> a. Tour length: 7 + 1 + 8 + 2 = 18

By examining these tours and their lengths, the exhaustive search finds that the shortest tours have a length of 11. 

Note that some tours are just the reverse direction of others (e.g., a-b-d-c-a and a-c-d-b-a both have length 11).
    

### Solve the following 0/1 Knapsack problem using Exhaustive Search, given a capacity W=10:
    
| Item | Weight | Value |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1    | 7      | $42   |
| 2    | 3      | $12   |
| 3    | 4      | $40   |
| 4    | 5      | $25   |

Knapsack capacity W = 10. Items with weights w1=7, w2=3, w3=4, w4=5 and values v1=$42, v2=$12, v3=$40, v4=$25. 

The exhaustive-search approach to the 0/1 Knapsack problem involves generating all possible subsets of the given items, checking if the total weight of each subset is within the knapsack's capacity (feasible subsets), and then finding the feasible subset with the maximum total value. 

For n=4 items, there are 2^4 = 16 possible subsets:
    
- ∅: Total weight 0, Total value $0. Feasible.
- {1}: Total weight 7, Total value $42. Feasible.
- {2}: Total weight 3, Total value $12. Feasible.
- {3}: Total weight 4, Total value $40. Feasible.
- {4}: Total weight 5, Total value $25. Feasible.
- {1, 2}: Total weight 7 + 3 = 10, Total value $42 + $12 = $54. Feasible.
- {1, 3}: Total weight 7 + 4 = 11, Total value $42 + $40 = $82. Not feasible (weight > 10).
- {1, 4}: Total weight 7 + 5 = 12, Total value $42 + $25 = $67. Not feasible (weight > 10).
- {2, 3}: Total weight 3 + 4 = 7, Total value $12 + $40 = $52. Feasible.
- {2, 4}: Total weight 3 + 5 = 8, Total value $12 + $25 = $37. Feasible.
- {3, 4}: Total weight 4 + 5 = 9, Total value $40 + $25 = $65. Feasible.
- {1, 2, 3}: Total weight 7 + 3 + 4 = 14, Total value $42 + $12 + $40 = $94. Not feasible (weight > 10).
- {1, 2, 4}: Total weight 7 + 3 + 5 = 15, Total value $42 + $12 + $25 = $79. Not feasible (weight > 10).
- {1, 3, 4}: Total weight 7 + 4 + 5 = 16, Total value $42 + $40 + $25 = $107. Not feasible (weight > 10).
- {2, 3, 4}: Total weight 3 + 4 + 5 = 12, Total value $12 + $40 + $25 = $77. Not feasible (weight > 10).
- {1, 2, 3, 4}: Total weight 7 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 19, Total value $42 + $12 + $40 + $25 = $119. Not feasible (weight > 10).
    
Comparing the values of the feasible subsets ($0, $42, $12, $40, $25, $54, $52, $37, $65), the maximum value is $65. 

The subset corresponding to this value is **{item 3, item 4}**. This is the optimal solution by exhaustive search for this instance.
