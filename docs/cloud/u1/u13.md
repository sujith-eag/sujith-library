# Cloud Deployment Models

A cloud deployment model defines the specific type of cloud environment based on ownership, scale, and access. It dictates where your infrastructure resides and who has control over it. Understanding these models is crucial for aligning a cloud strategy with business, security, and compliance requirements.

The four primary deployment models are **Public**, **Private**, **Community**, and **Hybrid**.


## Public Cloud

The public cloud is the most common deployment model, where infrastructure is owned and operated by a third-party cloud provider and delivered over the public internet.

What is a Public Cloud?

A public cloud is a multi-tenant environment where a third-party provider makes computing resources, such as virtual machines or storage, available to the general public over the internet.

Analogy: An Apartment Complex

Using a public cloud is like renting an apartment in a large complex. You share the building (infrastructure) with other tenants, and the landlord (cloud provider) is responsible for maintenance and security. It's cost-effective, scalable, and you only pay for the space you use.

:::

- **Key Characteristics**:
    
    - **Shared Infrastructure**: Resources are pooled and shared among multiple organizations (multi-tenancy).
        
    - **Pay-as-you-go Pricing**: You pay only for the resources you consume, reducing capital expenditure (CapEx).
        
    - **Massive Scalability**: Provides a near-limitless supply of resources that can be provisioned on demand.
        
    - **Global Accessibility**: Services are accessible from anywhere with an internet connection.
        
- **Benefits**:
    
    - **Cost-Effectiveness**: No upfront investment in physical hardware is required.
        
    - **High Reliability**: Providers operate multiple redundant data centers, ensuring high availability.
        
    - **Ease of Management**: The provider handles all infrastructure maintenance and updates.
        
- **Considerations**:
    
    - **Multi-tenancy Risks**: Sharing a machine with other subscribers can pose reliability and security risks, especially if co-resident with a competitor or adversary.
        
    - **Limited Control & Visibility**: You have less control over the underlying infrastructure, and details of the provider's operations are often proprietary and not disclosed.
        
    - **Data Governance**: Providers have data centers in various geographic locations, which can create legal and compliance challenges regarding data privacy and storage policies.
        
- **Common Examples**:
    
    - Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2
        
    - Microsoft Azure
        
    - Google Cloud Platform (GCP) / Google App Engine
        
    - IBM Cloud
        
    - Alibaba Cloud, Oracle Cloud, Tencent Cloud
        


## Private Cloud

A private cloud is a single-tenant environment where the infrastructure is dedicated to a single organization.

:::info

What is a Private Cloud?

A private cloud is an infrastructure provisioned for the exclusive use of one organization. It can be located at the organization's on-site data center or hosted by a third-party provider.

:::

:::tip

Analogy: A Private Home

A private cloud is like owning your own house. You have complete control over the space, security, and customization but are responsible for all maintenance, which requires significant investment.

:::

- **Key Characteristics**:
    
    - **Dedicated Resources**: The infrastructure is not shared with any other organization.
        
    - **Enhanced Security & Control**: Offers a higher level of control and privacy.
        
    - **Customization**: Can be tailored to meet specific business or compliance requirements.
        
- **Implementation Options**:
    
    - **On-Premises Private Cloud**: The organization owns and manages the infrastructure in its own data center, which requires significant capital investment and IT expertise.
        
    - **Hosted Private Cloud**: A third party hosts and manages the dedicated infrastructure for the organization off-site, reducing the management burden.
        
- **Benefits**:
    
    - **Greater Control**: Full control over hardware, software, and security configurations.
        
    - **Improved Security**: Isolation from other tenants reduces security risks.
        
    - **Compliance**: Easier to meet strict regulatory and data sovereignty requirements.
        
- **Considerations**:
    
    - **Higher Cost**: Requires significant upfront and ongoing investment.
        
    - **Management Overhead**: The organization is responsible for managing and maintaining the infrastructure.
        
    - **Limited Scalability**: Scalability is limited to the capacity of the owned infrastructure.
        
- **Common Examples**:
    
    - VMware Cloud Foundation / vCloud Infrastructure Suite
        
    - OpenStack
        
    - Eucalyptus, Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud
        
    - Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
        


## Community Cloud

The community cloud is a collaborative model where infrastructure is shared among several organizations with common goals and concerns.

:::info

What is a Community Cloud?

A community cloud is a multi-tenant platform provisioned for the shared use of a specific community of consumers from organizations that have shared concerns (e.g., security requirements or a common mission).

:::

- **Purpose**: It allows organizations to share the cost of a cloud platform that meets their collective needs, which might be too expensive for a single organization to build. It can be managed by the organizations themselves or by a third party.
    
- **Use Case**: This model is often used by government agencies, educational institutions, or healthcare organizations that need to adhere to specific regulations like HIPAA or FedRAMP.
    
- **Common Examples**:
    
    - AWS GovCloud (US)
        
    - Microsoft Azure Government
        


## Hybrid Cloud

A hybrid cloud combines two or more different deployment models (private, community, or public) to create a unified, flexible environment.

:::info

What is a Hybrid Cloud?

A hybrid cloud is comprised of two or more different cloud deployment models that remain unique entities but are bound together by standardized technology that enables data and application portability. It allows an organization to use the public cloud for non-sensitive operations while keeping sensitive data and applications secure in its private cloud.

:::

:::tip

Analogy: A House with a Rented Storage Unit

A hybrid cloud is like owning a house for your valuable items but renting a secure, scalable storage unit for less-used items or temporary projects. You get the security of home combined with the flexibility of a rental service.

:::

- **Benefits**:
    
    - **Flexibility**: Combines the control of a private cloud with the scalability of a public cloud.
        
    - **Cost Optimization**: Allows running steady workloads on-premises and leveraging the public cloud for variable demands ("cloud bursting").
        
    - **Enhanced Security**: Keep sensitive data on a private cloud while using public cloud services for other tasks.
        
- **Considerations**:
    
    - **Complexity**: Can be extremely complex to create, maintain, and secure due to the integration of different environments and split management responsibilities.
        
    - **Network Dependency**: Requires a reliable and secure network connection between the environments.
        
- **Common Examples**:
    
    - AWS Outposts
        
    - Azure Stack, Windows Azure
        
    - Google Anthos
        
    - VMware vCloud (often used in hybrid setups)
        


## Multi-Cloud

While a hybrid cloud combines different _types_ of infrastructure, a multi-cloud strategy involves using services from more than one public cloud provider.

:::info

What is Multi-Cloud?

A multi-cloud strategy involves leveraging two or more cloud computing services from different public cloud providers (e.g., using AWS for some services and Azure for others).

:::

- **Motivation**: Organizations adopt multi-cloud to **avoid vendor lock-in**, leverage **best-of-breed services** from different vendors, and improve **resilience** and redundancy.
    
- **Management**: A centralized system can connect to each provider's APIs to enable management from a single location.
    
- **Adoption**: According to the 2024 State of DevOps Report, 19.6% of organizations use multi-cloud.
    
- **Relationship with Hybrid Cloud**: A company can have both. For example, an organization with an on-premises data center (private cloud) that also uses services from AWS and Google Cloud is pursuing both a hybrid and a multi-cloud strategy.
    

:::tip

Hybrid vs. Multi-Cloud: What's the Difference?

- **Hybrid Cloud**: Connects **at least one public cloud** and **at least one private cloud**. It's about combining different _types_ of infrastructure.
    
- Multi-Cloud: Uses at least two public clouds. It's about using multiple providers of the same infrastructure type.

An organization can be multi-cloud without being hybrid, and vice versa.
